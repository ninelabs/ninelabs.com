Nine Labs hereby agrees upon receipt of materials from __________________ (“Client”), which contain information of a confidential and proprietary nature, to make all reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized disclosure, copying or publication of concerned information and to protect it as its own. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Nine Labs agrees to take such actions as may be reasonable to limit disclosure by advisers, associates and/or co-workers who may gain access to the concerned information.

Nine Labs agrees to use the information solely for evaluation of the project concerned and for no other purpose without the prior written permission of Client.

Nine Labs shall not be held responsible for information already in the public domain, information which becomes public domain through no action or omission of Nine Labs, or information obtained legally from a third party.

This non-disclosure agreement ends one (1) year after date of signature.
