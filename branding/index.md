# Objectives
A brand exists at the intersection of what you do and how people feel about it. When people see the Logo they should intuitively understand what you do. The Logo should evoke the right emotions, and set the proper expectations in the mind of the people who see it.
We aim to understand how you want to be perceived and create a Logo that aligns with your goals, and sets the proper tone and expectations from the start.

# Value to You
There are numerous ways to measure the value to your organization, to name a few:

* Our brand specialists will work with you to understand and codify the precise message you wish to communicate through your brand identity.
* A well conceived Logo will communicate your message and mission in a way words are unable to (a picture is worth a thousand words).
* The new Logo will serve as the mental bookmark in the minds of the public for the group and its activities.
* The new Logo will serve as a reference point and cornerstone for future branding and marketing efforts.
* Clear usage guidelines will ensure the Logo is used in a consistent manner, which communicates professionalism and trustworthiness to the general public.
* Clear usage guidelines simplify the process for all other design projects. Methodology and Options
