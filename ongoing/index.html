  <p class="lead">Why hire a single person when you can have an all-star team instead?</p>
  <p>Staffing up can be expensive. By the time you add up the acquisition costs, onboarding, HR, and other expenses you end up taking on a pretty big liability. Multiply all that by the number of people you want to hire and your P&L can get out of shape fast.</p>
  <p>It makes sense to have a <a href="/experience/">team like us</a> on demand. You get all the brain power of a big creative and technology department for the less than the cost of one A-list employee.</p>

        <p>The Nine Labs crew has been great. Easy to work with, responsive and focused on our success. They helped us take content we already had and package it in a more user-friendly format. Not an easy task for an event that has so many tentacles to it!</p>

        <p>Brad makes outsourcing graphic and design work very easy. He understands a wide variety of needs from print, to web, and back-end web work. He takes the time to talks through possible solutions and creative ways to meet our needs. We&rsquo;ve relied on Brad, and we intend to continue to work with him for our graphic design needs.</p>
