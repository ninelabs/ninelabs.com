  <p class="lead">Why hire a single person when you can have an all-star team instead?</p>
  <p>Staffing up can be expensive. By the time you add up the acquisition costs, onboarding, HR, and other expenses you end up taking on a pretty big liability. Multiply all that by the number of people you want to hire and your P&L can get out of shape fast.</p>
  <p>It makes sense to have a <a href="/experience/">team like us</a> on demand. You get all the brain power of a big creative and technology department for the less than the cost of one A-list employee.</p>

        <p>J is everything that&rsquo;s right with the web industry. Professional, knowledgeable and smart as hell. On top of that he has the ability to make people want to be a part of whatever he&rsquo;s working on. Any client would be lucky to have J leading their team.</p>
