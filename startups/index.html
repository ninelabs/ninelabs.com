  <p class="lead">It's a fact that design-led companies outpace the competition. This is a critical time for your business. Get an advantage with great design right from the start.</p>
  <h4>Why do we love startups?</h4>
  <p>Because we've been there. We know how hard it is to take an idea from a bar napkin to generating revenue, and we love helping companies make that leap.</p>
  <p>Before founding Nine Labs, <a href="/experience/j-cornelius.html">J Cornelius</a> helped <a href="http://www.coffeecup.com">CoffeeCup Software</a> grow from the back room of a coffee shop to over 300MM users across the globe. He launched <a href="http://bluedomino.com">BlueDomino Webhosting</a> and grew it from zero to 20,000 customers in less than a year before selling it. He mentors startups at <a href="http://www.atdc.org">ATDC</a> and numerous other startup events.</p>
  <h4>We're bootstrappers, too.</h4>
  <p>How you spend your money in the early days has a huge impact on the trajectory of your business. You can't afford to hire a full-time design and user experience team, but you can hire us to make you look good. </p>

        <p>When we hired Nine Labs, our project had stalled out with another firm.  The team at Nine Labs took the time to understand our brand and our vision. They delivered a customized website in the promised timeframe. Thanks, Nine Labs!</p>

        <p>They took the time to ask questions and really understand our brand and its goals. We were able to work with them to get a finished product quickly and efficiently. I loved working with the whole team. They&rsquo;re fun and listened to what I needed. Top notch firm.</p>
