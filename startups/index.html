    <!-- <h3>Scary thoughts.</h3> -->
    <p>You have a great idea, but you&rsquo;re not sure of the best way to make it happen. The good news is, <i>you&rsquo;re not alone</i>.</p>
    <p>Lots of companies have made it through this awkward phase. And with a little help <em>(maybe from us)</em>, so can yours.</p>
    <h4>What do Uber, AirBNB, Instagram, and other successful startups have in common?</h4>
    <p class="standout">Great Design.</p>
    <p>They understand that great design is a strategic weapon. From the very beginning, the founders of these companies knew they had to nail the <em>first impression</em>.</p>
    <p>Everyone from first-time users to Venture Capitalists will judge your company in milliseconds. You need your digital properties to but your company's best foot forward to everyone that meets you. Great design will give you confidence.</p>
    <p>The difference between people just using your product once and people falling in love with it is no accident. It&rsquo;s the result of well-thought-out, strategic design decisions.</p>
