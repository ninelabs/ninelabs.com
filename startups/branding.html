      <h4>Your brand is much more than a logo.</h4>
      <p>A well conceived name and logo will communicate your message and mission in a way words are unable to (remember, <i>a picture is worth a thousand words</i>).</p>
      <h4>The Value of Great Branding</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Your brand serves as the mental bookmark in the minds of the public for your organization and what it does. </li>
        <li>It's a reference point and cornerstone for future branding and marketing efforts.</li>
        <li>Clear usage guidelines will ensure your brand is used in a consistent manner, which communicates professionalism and trustworthiness to the general public.</li>
        <li>Clear usage guidelines simplify the process for all other design projects.</li>
      </ol>

        <p>When we hired Nine Labs, our project had stalled out with another firm.  The team at Nine Labs took the time to understand our brand and our vision. They delivered a customized website in the promised timeframe. Thanks, Nine Labs!</p>
