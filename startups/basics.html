    <p>We believe a brand is much more than a name and logo, but you have to start somewhere.</p>
    <h4>Value to you</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Our brand specialists will work with you to understand and codify the precise message you wish to communicate through your brand identity.</li>
      <li>A well conceived name and logo will communicate your message and mission in a way words are unable to (a picture is worth a thousand words).</li>
      <li>The new logo will serve as the mental bookmark in the minds of the public for the group and its activities.</li>
      <li>The new logo will serve as a reference point and cornerstone for future branding and marketing efforts.</li>
      <li>Clear usage guidelines will ensure the logo is used in a consistent manner, which communicates professionalism and trustworthiness to the general public.</li>
      <li>Clear usage guidelines simplify the process for all other design projects.</li>
    </ul>
