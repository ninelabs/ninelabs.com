  <p class="lead">Everyone has projects. It&rsquo;s how you get them done that matters.</p>
  <p>From creating a brand for a new company to a complete overhaul of a major ecommerce website, we&rsquo;ve got you covered. There&rsquo;s a good chance we&rsquo;ve had <a href="/reputation/">a similar project</a> in the past and know how to help get yours done.</p>

  <h3>We&rsquo;re on your side.</h3>
  <p>We <a href="/notes/better-together.html">work with your team</a> through active collaboration and rapid iteration. Our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_management">Agile process</a> ensures steady progress towards your goals and full transparency along the way.</p>

  <h3>Project Phases</h3>
  <ol class="padded">
    <li><strong>Research:</strong> It&rsquo;s important to understand the current situation and what needs to happen before we begin work. This phase is where we wrap our heads around the project and lay out the roadmap to get it done (our <a href="/short-term/">short-term sessions</a> are great for this phase).</li>
    <li><strong>Advise:</strong> All the knowledge and insight we gathered in the Reseach Phase gets compiled together into a report. We sit down with your team to go over the plan and map out what happens next.</li>
    <li><strong>Act:</strong> This is where the rubber meets the road. The project starts to take shape and the the plan comes together (we love it when that happens). We work alongside your team, leading the progess and making sure everyone knows what&rsquo;s happening.</li>
    <li><strong>Measure:</strong> Without looking at the results there's no way to know if the project accomplished it&rsquo;s goals. We set regular check-ins to look at the data and make sure our effects paid off.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Let&rsquo;s Chat About Your Project</h3>
  <p>Projects typically range from 3 weeks to 6 months with budgets from $20,000 to $500,000. If your project falls within those ranges, we should talk.</p>
  <div class="callout">
    <p>Have a small project, or unsure about your needs? Let&rsquo;s talk about a <a href="/short-term/">Short-Term session</a> instead.</p>
    <p>Have regular work, but don&rsquo;t want to staff up? Maybe an <a href="/ongoing/">Ongoing Relationship</a> is for you.</p>

        <p>J is everything that&rsquo;s right with the web industry. Professional, knowledgeable and smart as hell. On top of that he has the ability to make people want to be a part of whatever he&rsquo;s working on. Any client would be lucky to have J leading their team.</p>

        <p>The value they bring to a project is immeasurable. A very professional group, that is always focused on asking the right question, digging into the core of the clients problems, and coming up with excellent strategic solutions</p>
