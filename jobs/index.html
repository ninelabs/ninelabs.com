  <h3>How We Work</h3>
  <p>We&rsquo;re not a traditional company. Instead, we use something similar to the distributed <a href="http://www.ngenworks.com/blog/the-jellyfish-model/">Jellyfish Model</a>. This means you can work anywhere, anytime. We want you to do your best work, even if it&rsquo;s in your pajamas. We would prefer you be in Atlanta (because we support our hometown), but it&rsquo;s not required.</p>
  <p>Our office is in West Midtown, close to King Plow, Octane Coffee, Bartaco, Bocado and a handful of other great spots. We're a results only work environment, which means we don't care as much about when or where you do your work, so long as you get it done on time and on budget. Come as you are, wear what's appropriate for the day's tasks. That could be flip-flops or dress clothes, depending on the occasion.</p>
