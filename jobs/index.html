  <p class="lead">Our clients love us because we do great work. We do great work because we have great people. Are you great? Then we&rsquo;d love to have you join the team.</p>
  <h3>How We Work</h3>
  <p>We&rsquo;re not a traditional company. Instead, we use the distributed <a href="http://www.ngenworks.com/blog/the-jellyfish-model/">Jellyfish Model</a>. This means you can work anywhere, anytime. We want you to do your best work, even if it&rsquo;s in your pajamas. We would prefer you be in Atlanta (because we love to support our hometown), but it&rsquo;s not required.</p>
