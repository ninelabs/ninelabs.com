    <p class="lead">How well do you know your customer? Do you know what they think about your company and it&rsquo;s products or services?</p>
    <p>Answering &ldquo;people who pay us money&rdquo; is a cop out. Describing your customers by demographics isn't good enough.</p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re going after &ldquo;25-35 year old women&rdquo;, your focus isn&rsquo;t, well, focused.</p>

    <h4>What you need to know is:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>What do they believe?</li>
      <li>Who do they trust?</li>
      <li>What are they afraid of and who do they love?</li>
      <li>What are they seeking?</li>
      <li>Who are their friends?</li>
      <li>What do they talk about?</li>
    </ol>
