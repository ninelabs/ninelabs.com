title: We Don't Do That

In case you missed it, a lot has been happening over here at Nine Labs since Brad and I merged last year. [Miss that news](/notes/merger.html)?

We've added some [really smart people](/notes/growing-smart.html) to the team, and helped [lots of great clients](/about/reputation.html) improve their businesses. That's part of why I'm posting this. Seems a lot of people have the idea that we're just another web design shop.

_We actually don't build a lot of websitesâ€¦_

**We Improve User Experiences.**

That means figuring out how to make websites and mobile apps easier to use, why people abandon shopping carts, how to improve brand loyalty, etc. Think of us as a digital A-Team.

So next time you're thinking about how to make your website or mobile app more usable, how to make your app lovable, how to improve your "look and feel," or how you might use the web to grow your business, please think of us.
