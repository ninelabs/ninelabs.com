The past year at Nine Labs has been one for the books! It started with the merging of our (Brad and J) two companies, resulting in the new and improved Nine Labs. Once the merger was complete, business picked up at a breakneck pace, and we found ourselves covered up in work.

We quickly realized that future growth is dependent on quality staffing, so we set out to build a great place for smart people to do their best work. Over the last 12 months, the Nine Labs crew has almost tripled in size, and business continues to grow exponentially.

Allow us to introduce you to our new team members. They are some smart cookies, and chances are good that you’ll recognize a few of them!

###### July 2015
### Miranda Hocevar
##### Managing Director/Auburn football freak

Over the last decade, Miranda has worked for several well-known organizations in marketing, media relations and communications, sales, management, and business development. Oh, and did we also mention that she’s a two-time Emmy winner from her time as an associate producer at ESPN? Miranda now works as Nine Labs’ Managing Director, overseeing daily operations and client relations.

### Sierra Petrowski
##### Interactive Designer/Stevie Wonder superfan

Sierra came to us with a degree in marketing from Coastal Carolina University, having also studied interactive design at Creative Circus. Her skills, combined with her get-it-done attitude, make her a huge asset. She worked with us as a contractor over the last year, but is now a full-time member of our team.

### Jordan Watts
##### Content Strategist/carpool mom with a tattoo

Jordan recently joined us at Nine Labs to tackle marketing and brand development. She is a lover of words and imagery, and finding the perfect marriage of the two is something she is enthusiastic about. She is an author and a musician, and fits right in with this creative and sometimes-crazy crew.

### Patrick Haney
##### Presentation Layer Developer/father to Milo the terrier

Patrick is a designer-developer hybrid with 17 years of experience working with companies of all sizes. He and his wife, Jenna, now run their own design studio outside of Rochester, NY, and he graciously works with Nine Labs to present great results on time, every time.

###### Sept. 2015
### Paige Templeton
##### UX Designer/snowboarding aficionado

A designer who often finds herself lost in the creative realm, Paige earned a BA in Integrative Studies at Oakland University. Prior to moving to Atlanta, she worked as a junior front-end developer at Mercury Studio in Detroit, MI. She recently came on board with Nine Labs to help with UX/UI and front-end development. She’s a much-needed addition to the company.

### Jacklyn Burgan
##### UX Researcher/Strategist/competitive dancer

Basically, Jacklyn is sort of a big deal. She’s a user-experience researcher and strategist with experience in the corporate, agency, and start-up worlds. She’s passionate about usability, empathetic design, and collaboration. She is currently a user-experience researcher at Pardot, a Salesforce Company, and a researcher/strategist at Nine Labs. We’re thrilled to have her on board.

###### Oct. 2015
### Charline Leger
##### Visual Designer/everyone’s token foreign friend

Charline has gained invaluable experience around the world in art and design. She holds a master’s degree in global design and is passionate about approaching her work with inspiration. She believes that designers should not be constrained by borders or language, a theme that is carried throughout her work. She’s got a great eye, and we are excited to have her at Nine Labs.

###### Oct. 2015
### Kellye Call
##### Project Manager/trained contemporary dancer

Kellye is a 2012 graduate of the University of Georgia, where she received her Bachelor of Arts in Political Science degree, along with a minor in dance. She then devoted her time and talents to GivingPoint, ultimately taking on the role of Sr. Digital Strategist by managing the ongoing development and advancement of the company’s website and social media platforms. We couldn’t be more excited that she’s joining the Nine Labs family.

In short, it takes a great team to make great design happen, and Nine Labs has it. We believe the future is bright and that we are staffed with the best people to get us there. Cheers to what lies ahead!
