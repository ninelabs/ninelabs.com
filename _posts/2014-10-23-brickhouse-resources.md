When we first spoke with Wendy and Larry they were concerned about how their company was perceived online. They are dynamic people who feel that most recruiting websites are too sterile and lack personality.

**We agree.** We worked with them to discover their voice, what emotions and thoughts they wanted people to get when they vistied their website, and what impression they wanted people to leave with. Through several excersizes to define the proper voice and tone we found a casual and lighthearted, yet direct way of telling their story.
