### Do you feel like you&rsquo;re never paid enough for your work?
Join us on March 20th at Polygon for our first in a series of workshops on running a shop.

Are you losing money on most of your projects? Are your client revisions out of control? Does your profit seem to melt away as each project goes along? Are you spending most of your time writing proposals only to lose the work?

#### Correctly pricing your client work for profit isn&rsquo;t a guessing game. You can get control.
This is a hands-on workshop made specifically for creative business owners. Together, we will look at specific ways to tackle pricing and profit in your business. We'll have open discussions about rates, prices, and profit using actual projects. You&rsquo;ll walk away with real numbers and tools to use in your business to get control of your pricing strategy the very same day.
