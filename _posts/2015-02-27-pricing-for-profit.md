### Do you feel like you&rsquo;re never paid enough for your work?
Join us on March 20th at Polygon for our first in a series of workshops on running a shop.

### Pricing your client work isn't a guessing game. You can get control.
The purpose of this workshop is to dig into the nuts and bolts of pricing your work for long-term sustainability.  
Profit, growth, and freedom won’t come cheap, but there are ways to make it happen faster. You can get a handle on revisions, freelancers and employees, and the crazy cycle of proposals and portfolios. 

This is a hands-on workshop made specifically for creative business owners or freelancers. Together, we will look at specific ways to tackle pricing and profit in your business. We'll have open discussions about rates, prices, and profit using actual projects. You’ll walk away with real numbers and tools to use in your business to get control of your pricing strategy the very same day.
