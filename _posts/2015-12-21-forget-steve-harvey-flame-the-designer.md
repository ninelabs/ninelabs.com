Unless you live under a rock, by now you&rsquo;ve definitely seen and heard/read/talked about the horrifyingly embarrassing moment Steve Harvey _(and the rest of us)_ had to endure as he mispronounced Miss Colombia winner of the 2015 Miss Universe pageant. I don&rsquo;t mean he mispronounced the _word_ Colombia. I mean he literally pronounced the _WRONG WOMAN_ winner of the pageant.

You see, Miss Colombia was actually 1st runner up; Miss Philippines won the pageant and _(ultimately)_ took the crown. The three-or-so minutes of live television following his snafu was awkward as hell. It was kind of like a bad accident &mdash; you _want_ to look away, you know you _should_ look away, but you _just can&rsquo;t_ look away.

#### In case you missed it, take a few minutes and watch this. I promise, you won&rsquo;t be able to look away, either:

That&rsquo;s three minutes of your life you&rsquo;ll never get back. And three minutes of Steve Harvey&rsquo;s life that he&rsquo;ll never, ever live down. Imagine being &ldquo;that guy&rdquo; for the rest of your days.

Like any professional should, Steve immediately took the fall and claimed responsibility for the terrible mistake (amidst the booing of the crowd). It was the right thing to do, the classy thing to do. However, if I&rsquo;m being honest, I think his response should have been something more along of the lines of:

> “Alright, let me just take control of this. This is exactly what was on the HORRIBLY-DESIGNED card. Have you seen this thing? Would YOU be able to read these results correctly? Basically, what I&rsquo;m trying to say is that it was our DESIGNER&rsquo;S fault. Because this card, THIS CARD RIGHT HERE, is pitifully designed. He/she will take responsibility for this. This is a terrible end product and should never have seen the light of day. It was a horrible mistake &mdash; just look at this card. Please don&rsquo;t hold it against me. Please don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m just a comedian. Now, where&rsquo;s my check &mdash; I&rsquo;m out.”

####Nobody would&rsquo;ve blamed you, Steve.

Consider for a moment how an organization like the Miss Universe pageant could/would allow a product like that card to ever make it past the first draft? Hell, that probably _WAS_ the first draft! This company has a multi-multi-multi-million dollar budget, and _THIS_ is the card they handed to Steve Harvey to use as his guide for announcing the winner?

People, let&rsquo;s get real for a second. There is no excuse -- _NO EXCUSE_ -- for that type of shoddy design. It&rsquo;s pathetic. With all that money and access to the world&rsquo;s best design talent, this is the best they could do?

It&rsquo;s pretty safe to say that user experience wasn&rsquo;t researched _(or even considered)_ in the Miss-Universe-2015-results-card design process. Nothing about this card screams “Pay attention! Important information lies ahead!” Headings aren&rsquo;t clear, symmetry is non-existent, and there&rsquo;s no information or design hierarchy in the general vicinity. It&rsquo;s atrocious.

To make matters worse, the winner&rsquo;s information sits at the bottom right-hand corner of the card when everything else is left justified. Harvey was holding the mic in his left hand and the cue card in his right. _Let that sink in for a second._ If he was holding the card in his right hand, chances are good that his hand was covered up the information on the bottom right side of the card. _Where the winner&rsquo;s information was printed. _

Yes, they needed the template to be simple so it was ready to be filled in and printed at any given moment. Simple design is fine &mdash; as long as it&rsquo;s user-friendly and clear, too.

This is a perfect _(and, unfortunately, public)_ example of a UX fail. Anybody could have misread that card, because the information wasn&rsquo;t presented clearly. The user _(in this case, Steve)_ was borderline set up for failure, and fail he did.

There&rsquo;s always a silver lining, though, right? In this case, it&rsquo;s that we all saw something awful yet hilarious go down on live TV, and it involved the world&rsquo;s _(I mean, the universe&rsquo;s)_ most famous beauty pageant, which, let&rsquo;s be honest, we all love to hate. There&rsquo;s something about that many genetically _(and artificially)_ flawless people being in one place at one time that is unsettling, am I right? And ultimately, it made for an uncomfortable few minutes, great water-cooler talk, and this unforgettable literary piece.

So, unnamed designer&hellip;thank you, I guess? And Miss Universe people, just a word of advice:

#### Next time you need someone to design your cue cards, why don&rsquo;t you just hire us?

&lsquo;Cause this took 10 minutes, and I&rsquo;m pretty sure, had you used it, Steve Harvey would be sleeping better tonight.
