title: 2015 In Review
---

And just like that, another year is gone. The holidays have passed, the winter cold has settled in, and, if you&rsquo;re anything like most folks, you&rsquo;ve set some goals for the new year. We look ahead with expectation, determined to grow and succeed in ways we never have before, as we say goodbye to 2015.

Wisdom also urges us to take a step back, a pause, to evaluate the year gone by. What growth did we experience? What lessons did we learn? We grieve our losses and celebrate our victories, all in hopes that those things spur us on in 2016.

As we closed out the year, the Nine Labs staff did some evaluating of our own. We paused and considered all that happened in our industry in 2015. In doing so, we found that some common themes emerged, and we thought we&rsquo;d share them with you.

###Rdio dies and Spotify lives on.

![Farewell Rdio](//s3.amazonaws.com/ninelabs.com/notes-farewell-rdio.jpg)

To some, this was the travesty of all travesties. I think you know what I mean when I say that people who used Rdio _loved_ Rdio. Many of our team members _loved_ Rdio. We were disappointed on so many levels to hear of its death, and I think the common sadness was rooted in this: user experience won and design lost. Again.

Rdio focused heavily on design, and as a result people with an eye for well-designed interfaces fell in love with the application. It was built with true music purists in mind; it featured album-centric design and exploration rather than singles and track-drive exploration like you&rsquo;d find on Spotify.

Our CXO, [/about/brad-weaver.html](Brad Weaver), took the news of Rdio&rsquo;s death especially hard. He had this to say about the subject:

> I&rsquo;ll miss the beautiful minimalism of Rdio, and that oh-so-perfect shade of blue, but most of all I&rsquo;ll miss the community-driven discovery. While Spotify does a great job of pushing new singles out, it handles albums terribly. I get that millennials are only interested in tracks (and have the attention span of Dory), but there is still a large group of users who appreciate an artist&rsquo;s original vision for an entire album. Finding and discovering albums on Spotify is &mdash; how can I put this lightly &mdash; a trainwreck. Even if you do find an artist that you want to explore, telling the difference between albums, singles, EPs, and live sessions is nigh impossible. No weight shift, no separation, and no hierarchy is given other than plain headers with razor thin lines. It&rsquo;s minimalism done horribly wrong, wrapped in an expensive font and pretty pictures. Rdio, why did you leave me!?!? Why?!?!

Brad&rsquo;s perspective is extremely valid, and he of all people should understand the profound loss Rdio lovers have experienced; after all, he&rsquo;s an incredibly talented designer and a thought leader in the industry. The problem? Most people, the everyday Joes/Janes of this world, _don&rsquo;t have an eye for well-designed interfaces like Brad does._

This leads us to why Spotify lives on (in spite of the fact that several people I know would like to take it out back and put it out of its misery): it&rsquo;s focus is primarily on user experience. That&rsquo;s what everyday Joes and Janes care about. Is it intuitive? Is it easy to navigate? The majority of the population needs these elements of design to function well in order for them to build trust in an app, and Spotify gives that to them. In short, ugly wins again.

Jacklyn Burgan, Director of UX Strategy at Nine Labs, seems to think, though, that Spotify is focusing less and less on the user, which could spell trouble for the app in 2016.

> Can someone who works for Spotify tell me what the hell is happening in their product development team? I feel like every time I update the app I have to relearn how to use it. If I had a better alternative, I&rsquo;d switch services, but Rdio (may it rest in peace) and Apple Music (dear God...just...no) are both non-options. And what was the thought process behind the overhaul of the inbox? That was the one feature that made Spotify different and valuable to me! I&rsquo;m beginning to think I may have to go back to the stone age and just start buying my music and listening to it on Winamp.

But how do you really feel, Jacklyn?

In all seriousness, we&rsquo;re sad to see small, specialized services like Rdio swallowed up by the giants, and we&rsquo;re hoping 2016 brings us a music service that has the best of both worlds. Is it too much to ask for an app that&rsquo;s well designed AND user friendly? We think not.

###FourSquare gives birth to Swarm.

![Foursquare is now Swarm](//s3.amazonaws.com/ninelabs.com/notes-foursquare-swarm.png)

We&rsquo;re still baffled as to why FourSquare made this move. Why would an app that was designed to allow check-ins and real-time location sharing with friends remove one of its foundational elements (the ability to check in) and build an new company around it? It seems completely unnecessary, and has been a major turn-off for FourSquare users, or at least the ones in our office. It appears that FourSquare/Swarm realized their mistake, too, because it didn&rsquo;t take long for them to change their strategy _again_ in order to try and keep customers happy. The result? Well, they lost (and are still losing) customers, primarily because their users couldn&rsquo;t figure out where to go to do basic things anymore.

Foursquare/Swarm still exists, but it&rsquo;s not the powerhouse it once was. This is a great example of how not to muddy the design waters, and a good reminder that sometimes the best thing you can do is stop while you&rsquo;re ahead.

###Farewell to HopStop.

![Farewell HopStop](//s3.amazonaws.com/ninelabs.com/notes-hopstop.jpg)

Here we have yet another example of a really well-designed, useful app that was swallowed up by Apple, only to ultimately be replaced by one of the brand&rsquo;s own creations. HopStop was an online city transit guide that offered detailed, door-to-door biking, bus, subway, taxi, train, and walking directions in real time, as well as official transit maps for 600 cities around the world. In 2011, HopStop was named one of the top 100 fastest growing software companies in the United States, and was a Nine Labs team favorite.

Jacklyn Burgan weighed in again on HopStop&rsquo;s demise:

> HopStop was one of the first apps I downloaded when I started traveling to NYC. It was also the app I heavily relied on while I lived there in 2014. It gave me door-to-door directions and helped me plan my travel around train schedules. Most of all, it made a girl who was incredibly anxious and unfamiliar with a subway system brave enough to try to navigate it on her own. RIP, HopStop.

Apple acquired HopStop in 2013, and soon after dropped support for the Windows and Android phones. As of October 2015, the HopStop app is not available on any platform, with Apple opting to add copycat transit features to its iOS 9 Maps update. Reviews of Apple&rsquo;s offering have been mixed, to put it mildly, mostly due to the fact that they discontinued support for over 100 cities previously supported by HopStop.

###Stick a fork in Adobe Flash - it&rsquo;s done.

![RIP Flash - Finally!](http://s3.amazonaws.com/ninelabs.com/notes-rip-flash.jpg)

Adobe is killing Flash as we know it. The name is going away, and designers are planning a celebration, not a funeral. Flash is that person you dated in college, the one who was cute and well-dressed and seemed to have a bright future, only for you to find out that, in reality, he/she was a total psycho. Flash looked great but wasn&rsquo;t accessible; it was hard to get much, if any, content out of it. The final product behaved like a movie, not a website, and its constant stream of bugs made us CRAZY. One thing is for sure: it was not the right technology for the marketplace, and our team will NOT be sad to see it go.

###Twitter tightens its API...again.

Social media users have surely noticed that Twitter&rsquo;s API (application programming interface) is not nearly as open as it once was. Every time Twitter tightens its API, it results in other apps having a more difficult time communicating with Twitter. This breeds frustrated users who find it nearly impossible to come up with a useful work around. What is Twitter&rsquo;s end game? It&rsquo;s apparent that they&rsquo;re edging out third-party clients for their own financial gain. However, what Twitter may well be forgetting is that when they radically pivot away from the ecosystem that helped them grow, they&rsquo;re essentially turning their backs on the very developers and loyalists they need to sustain the business. Worse, by eradicating third-party apps they take away the nuanced and customized experiences people love about using the service.Time will tell whether this strategy works for or against Twitter. We have our opinions, but we&rsquo;ll keep them to ourselves for now.

##So&hellip; why does any of this matter?

Like I mentioned at the start of this post, we review things in hindsight in order to gain wisdom and insight. At Nine Labs, we desire to learn from the best, both from their successes AND their failures, in hopes that it makes us better at what we do. If we can learn from others&rsquo; mistakes, that&rsquo;s one less failure we have to experience. If we can gain insight into a solidly-constructed strategy, then we have a leg up. It&rsquo;s our goal to consistently provide first-class design services to our clients, and sometimes the best way to do that is to hit the pause button.

Here&rsquo;s to a successful, fulfilling 2016, and a continued community-wide drive toward delivering high-quality design and raising the standard of excellence for everyone in the industry.
