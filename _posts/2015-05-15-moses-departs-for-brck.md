It&rsquo;s bittersweet for us to announce today that Moses Ngone, our Director of Engineering, has accepted an exciting opportunity to be join the growing team at [BRCK](https://www.brck.com/).

The BRCK is a versatile, mobile router to allow for a stable Internet connection in areas where that has typically been a pipe dream. It&rsquo;s ruggedly designed and made to work in harsh areas where electricity may be unreliable. Users can manage their BRCKs from the cloud and expand its capabilities with custom services and applications.

In the team&rsquo;s words:

> We realized that the way the entire world is connecting to the web is changing. We no longer only get online via desktops in our office with an ethernet connection, we have multiple devices, and mobile connectivity is crucial.

Mo has been an entrepreneur at heart since his school days, and he&rsquo;s joining a group of fellow Kenyans to revolutionize Internet access in rural or other areas which have historically offered only unstable connections at best.

The BRCK was launched via a succesful Kickstarter campaign and is already [available for purchase](http://shop.brck.com/brcks/brck-v1.html). Mo will be applying his coding chops to improve BRCK for thier users and help the company acheive its goals.

We&rsquo;ll miss having Mo just a desk away, but luckily he&rsquo;s not going too far! BRCK are fellow members of Strongbox West, so we&rsquo;ll get the chance to wave at him in the halls and maybe share a glass of whiskey from time to time.

We wish Mo and BRCK the best of luck.
