> TL;DR: The mission of AWDG was to foster the Atlanta web community. We did it. It's time to turn the page.

When I first moved back to Atlanta in July of 2008 the web design and development community didn't exist. There were lots of talented people here, but they weren't connected.

Wanting to meet like-minded people, I went to Meetup.com and found the Web Designers meetup. I joined and went to my first event hoping to meet some great people. I was the only one there. The organizer didn't even show up. That was August 2008.

The same thing happened in September. There I was at Octane Westside in a room full of MacBooks and lattes, looking for fellow web nerds. The meetup had around 230 members, but I was the only one there.

## We Built It. They Came.
Then in October the organizer stepped down, and I took over. After familiarizing myself with Meetup, I put a date on the calendar for the next event and sent a message to the 200 or so people in the group. I told them we should meet to plot the future of the web community in Atlanta. 83 people showed up. The staff at Octane didn't know what was happening.

People wanted community, they wanted to hear from leaders in the industry, but nobody was making that happen. So I did. We started bringing in well known and respected people like [Dan Rubin](http://twitter.com/danrubin), [Jared Spool](http://www.uie.com/jared-live/), [Whitney Hess](http://whitneyhess.com/), [Nick Finck](http://twitter.com/nickf), [Molly Holzschlag](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Holzschlag), [Jason Beaird](http://twitter.com/jasongraphix), [Jonathan Snook](http://snook.ca/), [Denise Jacobs](http://denisejacobs.com/), [Carl Smith](http://twitter.com/carlsmith), and many more to speak on a monthly basis. And the community grew.

With the help of [lots of great people](https://twitter.com/awdg/lists/hall-of-fame/members) the group has now hosted over 200 events and grown to over 3,200 members all across the metro area. According to Meetup, it's the largest web-focused meetup group in the Southeast. That's quite an accomplishment. Thank you, Atlanta.

## A Different City
Fast forward to March 2015 and the community in Atlanta looks quite different. I did some toying around with the Meetup API and found there are now [278 tech meetups](https://github.com/ninelabs/atl-tech-meetups) in the Atlanta area. Most of them have been created within the last couple years.

From bloggers to coders to marketers, we have it covered. There are so many groups now that people are starting to create niche groups to serve ever smaller segments of the community. Hell, we even have [our own event space](http://polygontatl.com). This is a great thing.

Looking around the city today, I see a dizzying amount of activity. There are events nearly every night. Everyone has Twitter, Facebook, and email promos going non-stop. I've heard from many people that the noise is too much. They've filtered the emails, unfollowed the social feeds, and muted notifications for all but the groups they feel most attached to.

AWDG has been somewhat at the forefront of the web scene in Atlanta for a while. It's no longer necessary for AWDG to carry the banner for everyone. There are enough specialized
groups and events for anyone who looks to find something to suit them.

## Turning the Volume Down
Beginning in April 2015 AWDG will scale back to one event per month. These events will still feature high-quality content from local and nationally known speakers. They will still be on the last Thursday of the month. They will still be awesome.

### No More Monthly Socials
Don't worry, we'll still host a get together from time-to-time. They just won't be every month, and not all over town.

### A Lot Less Email and Social Noise
No more monthly newsletters, weekly event roundups, or constant tweet blasting. We respect your attention more than that. For now we'll only let you know about our one event per month, and post some occasional cool stuff on social channels. The signal to noise ratio will improve substantially.

_Note: If you're on the [AWDG email list](http://www.awdg.org/join/) you'll see one more email with instructions on where to get info about other groups and happenings around town._

## What About the Kickstarter?
Glad you asked. There were [164 backers](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jcornelius/official-awdg-website/) and we love each one of you. Some of you chose t-shirts, posters, and other rewards. All of them shipped by August of 2014. _That was [some sweet swag](http://www.awdg.org/blog/kickstarter-rewards.html), eh?_

We launched the [official AWDG website](http://www.awdg.org) back in October with a minimal set of features. We've made significant progress on the [pattern library and style guide](http://www.awdg.org/styleguide) since then. It's almost to a point where any other group could use the code to build their own website. We're going to wrap up [a few final features](https://github.com/awdg/awdg.org/issues) and call it version 1.0. From there, those among you who are interested can continue to build on top of the foundation we've laid.

If you're curious about the money, take a look at the [campaign financials](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-4QVoHzRuAAcbch19dspprmi5nPoZeL4h-6wcIRcf9g/edit?usp=sharing) and you'll see exactly how it was used.

## What else?
We're definitely not riding off into the sunset. We're going to focus on doing [great work for clients](/approach/), hosting the [Web Afternoon](http://webafternoon.com) event series, and running [Polygon](http://polygonatl.com) so all the other groups have a great place for their events.

If you have thoughts about all this we'd love to hear them. Find us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/awdg), [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/atlantaweb), or [good old-fashioned email](jc@ninelabs.com).

Thanks to all the great people who've helped make the Atlanta tech community strong. You know who you are. ;)
