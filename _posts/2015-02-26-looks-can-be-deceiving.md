###CAUTION: pleasing aesthetics do NOT always equal effectiveness.

Some designs might look great but don't seem to generate results for the business. Others might be visually underwhelming and drive a lot of revenue (just look at craigslist).

Finding the balance between appearance and functionality is essential to the success of any project. The design process should consider the intended outcome of the page/site/app, and tailor every element to help achieve it.

Anything less is just bad design.
