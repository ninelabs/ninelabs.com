BRASH is an indie coffee company with shops in Atlanta and Chattanooga. They have a passion for finding and sharing the best possible coffee they can. They literally travel the world forging relationships with independant farmers and bringing raw beans back to the US where they roast each batch by hand.

When they approached us they already had a great brand identity, but needed help telling their story online and offering their delicious coffee for sale. We helped create a Squarespace site which captures the essence of their brand and communicates their message with a clean and simple design.
