The web developer's workflow can look different everyday. With the influx of new tools, processes and applications, it sometimes seems like we need to learn how to use every. single. one.

**Join us** on Friday, April 24, for a workshop led my Moses Ngone, Partner and Director of Development at Nine Labs. 

In this hands-on workshop, we'll explore the use and combination of some new "shiny objects," tried and true stalwarts, and a couple of hidden gems. By piecing them all together, you'll acquire a great bag of tricks that won't leave you overwhelmed.

**Who can benefit from this workshop?** Anyone who writes code regularly enough to feel the pain of inefficient workflows! Team leads, engineering managers, and members of development teams will pick up strategies for working more smoothly together, and individual developers will learn how to get their jobs done with a minimum of angst.

## What We'll Cover:
- Setting up your environment using package managers like Bower, NPM, Composer, and Homebrew
- Making your code-writing efficient with task runners, including Gulp and Grunt
- Running local application servers for staging (Jekyll, PHP, Vagrant, Docker, Python)
- Continuous integration and deployment (including Capistrano, Jenkins, and Strider)
- Using "chat ops" with Slack and Hubot

## A Few Pre-requisites:
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Familiarity with the commandline
- Comfortable with using version control
- A GitHub account

Macs are preferred, as many of the tools we'll be exploring play best with the Mac OS.

You'll get a chance to fork a project from GitHub and experience the streamlined development process for yourself.
