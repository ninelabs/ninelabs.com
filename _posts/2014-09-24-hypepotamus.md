Hypepotamus is a community publication that spreads awareness about entrepreneurs, innovative companies, and promising talent in Atlanta. Hype&rsquo;s editorial team maintains an up-to-the-minute calendar of tech-related events, tweets up a storm, and publishes numerous blog posts per week.

## The Situation
Atlanta&rsquo;s definitive source for startup and technology news needed an update. Originally launched as an open, collaborative workspace for entrepreneurs, Hype&rsquo;s focus ultimately shifted toward media. The website was receiving increased traffic and delivering more content than ever, yet it had an outdated theme and a clunky backend.

## The Solution
With thousands of posts already on a WordPress blog, migrating to another platform didn&rsquo;t make sense. Instead, we helped revitalize Hype&rsquo;s image with a theme customized to their needs. Our Dev-Ops team cloned the existing site, built a new one, and synced the content into its revitalized home, with a new theme and a restructured backend. We performed a plugin audit and ran tests to make sure the site was performing optimally.

## The Outcome
Hypepotamus&rsquo; site is now as well-oiled a machine as its media team. All of the content and history has been preserved, but the site loads faster and presents a cleaner face to the world. Editor Tricia Whitlock brought a wealth of ideas to the table, and she was pleased that our team was able to organize and craft them into exactly what she needed. With everyone involed being communicative and responsive, we were able to complete this project on a short timeframe.

From start to finish, Hypepotamus&rsquo; revamp took just under 60 hours of work. Looking for something similar? Check out our [Short-Term Consulting](https://ninelabs.com/short-term/) to see if the way we work might be the right fit for your branding needs!
