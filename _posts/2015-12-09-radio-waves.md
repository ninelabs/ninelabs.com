It&rsquo;s always a treat when one of our own graces the radio waves! This week, Nine Labs founder and president, J Cornelius, had the pleasure of sitting down with Eric Holtzclaw of [the Eric Holtzclaw Show](http://biz1190.com/schedule) (11a-12p, weekdays). Eric is a &ldquo;serial entrepreneur&rdquo; with 20+ years experience, and he&rsquo;s passionate about helping other self-starters along their journeys.

Eric and J talked user-friendly websites and mobile sites for business, and also touched on Samsung&rsquo;s new &ldquo;consumer friendly&rdquo; [VR headset](http://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/wearables/gear-vr/).

I could tell you more, but I think you&rsquo;d rather hear the words from the horses&rsquo; mouths. Take a few minutes and listen to J and Eric&rsquo;s exchange here:
