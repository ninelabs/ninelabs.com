We know our way around the web, so when our own website needed a refresh, we turned to the trusted processes we use every day with clients to make the changes it needed.

## The Situation
The Nine Labs brand was well-established, but with our recent [merger](https://ninelabs.com/notes/merger.html) the existing website was no longer an accurate representation of who we are as a company. Plus, we had a list of frequently asked questions that we knew should be addressed in plain English for our clients.

## The Solution
We're busy with client work, but we didn't want to wait forever to update our site, so we scheduled a one-day sprint to knock out the bulk of the work. We took a minimalist approach and built our design around the content we knew we needed. The logo stayed the same, but we stripped down the color palette to keep things as simple as possible. Bootstrap was too heavy for our needs, so we built our own [responsive CSS grid system](https://gist.github.com/jcornelius/ab9e5abfd3aa22043d8a) in Sass. [Brad](/experience/brad-weaver.html) made all of the decisions about typography so that we wouldn't have to think about that later.

When laying out the site, we made our decisions based on an intuitive information architecture. We addressed the questions we got frequently first and made sure the focus of the site was not on *us* but rather on *the client's needs*. We weren't concerned with what other designers would like but with what our clients needed to know.

## The Outcome
The work we put in upfront has made it possible for us not to be bogged down with design decisions for our own site while we're busy with other projects. Our website is an evolving organism, and its design flexible enough that we don't have to worry about how new content will fit in. By starting with basic design systems, we've been able to take an iterative, additive approach to keeping our site current.

Since the refresh, we've found that client's initial questions have more to do with their projects and less to do with our capabilities. Our straightforward approach to sharing information helps clients to get a better sense from the beginning of whether our teams will be a good fit. We had a client thank us recently for not wasting his time. He was able to find everything he needed on our website to make an initial decision about working with us. We'll call that a success.
