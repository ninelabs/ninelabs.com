One of the most common questions we hear is something along the lines of "Who is your perfect client?"

We&rsquo;ve noticed the best results happen when we work with companies who fit an interesting set of criteria. Companies of a certain size, with a need for a certain skillset (ours), and who are in one of two phases of their business.

- Currently using or planning to use the web and digital services in their business.
- Revenues less than $1,000,000, or over $10,000,000.
- Undergoing change in the organization, market, or both.
- Recongnizes the world is changing around them.

Seem like an odd set of criteria? I&rsquo;ll explain.

### Revenue Size
Companies with revenues under $1MM typically are small teams with precises expertise directly related to their business. Sometimes these teams also have branding, user experience, and/or design skills on board. Most of the time they don&rsquo;t. Even when they do, they are so focused on the core business that these skills get pushed aside (and rightly so).

Companies with revenues over $10MM usually have a department or group on staff who handle much of their design and UX work. Sometimes, becuase these teams operate in a silo they feel disconnected from the latest best practices, or simply are looking for second opinion to help guide them.

### Stage of Business
Change is hard. Especially when you&rsquo;re running a company. Every company goes through changes (it&rsquo;s part of survival). How they manange that change is vital to their success.

Reknown consultant and businessman [Les McKeown](http://www.predictablesuccess.com/) has a theory of the lifecycle of business which makes a lot of sense, and we&rsquo;ve seen this cycle play out time and time again.

The two phases where we can have the most impact are "White Water" and "Treadmill". This is when companies realize that in order to stay alive they need smart strategic thinking and effective experience design. We&rsquo;re able to help companies in these phases by understanding their business goals and working alongside them to find and implement ways to acheive them.

### Need for our Skills
You can't do everything well. Perhaps the most important thing is that a company recognize to be great at their core business they need to focus on that and let other experts help with non-core functions. It's often more costly to try to do something yourself than to hire a professional to do it right the first time.


## Why We&rsquo;re a Great Option
We can help companies of both sizes by offering a diverse range of services and skills for the same cost as a full-time staff member. We also offer [a-la-carte sessions](/sessions/) that make it possible to get our thoughts and expertise without a huge commitment.

This is a great benefit for the company:

- No HR and related recruiting headaches.
- Faster spin-up time on projects since they aren&rsquo;t looking for "the right person".
- Instead of one person, they get a team with many diverse skills.
- Less risk since they aren&rsquo;t relying on a single person (think sick days).
- Clearer operational and legal structure.

### Summary

We love helping companies overcome business and design obstacles to succeed in their business. Nothing pleases us more than working with smart people on interesting problems. So if your business fits these criteria [we should talk](/contact/).
