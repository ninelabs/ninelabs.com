When you run the largest crowdfunding event in the world, you need a website that works well for a very diverse audience. OneSpark approached us with a need for clear direction on how to communicate myriad types of information to all the distinct groups of their users.

## The Situation
OneSpark was already running a Ruby on Rails application, but they lacked the front end and UX skills they needed to make the site work as well as it could. They needed a clean design and leadership to bring the project to completion.

## The Solution
This project is ongoing, and we&rsquo;re rolling out elements of the site as the big event draws closer. We&rsquo;ve worked with the OneSpark team to figure out exactly what information needs to be on each page in order to implement an easy-to-understand structure for navigating the site. Rather than replacing everything that was already in place, we&rsquo;re providing a structure around development of new content and how it fits with existing content. The goal is to optimize how their news and information is displayed to the world. We&rsquo;ve already created a custom map of the host hotels to assist participants as they begin planning their travel.

## The Outcome
