When you run the largest crowdfunding event in the world you need a website that works well for a very diverse audience. OneSpark approached us with a need for clear direction on how to communicate myriad types of information to all the distict groups of their audience.

We&rsquo;re helping by providing a structure around development of new content and how it fits with existing content, and how their news and information is displayed to the world.
