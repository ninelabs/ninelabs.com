Strongbox West is a modern coworking space designed to offer freelancers, start-ups, and creative types an alternative to working at home or alone. It provides a comfortable and professional place to work heads down when you need to but also to network and collaborate with like-minded people.

## The Situation
Atlanta&rsquo;s original coworking spot had outgrown their building. Moving from 9,000 sq. ft. to over 44,000 sq. ft. is a major upgrade, and Strongbox wanted to upgrade their identity along with their digs. So, they approached us to come up with a new logo to help communicate that things had changed.

## The Solution
[Brad](/about/brad-weaver.html) worked with the Strongbox West team to develop a new brand direction. The old logo reflected the industrial feel of the coworking space, but it needed to be modernized. We took inspiration for the logo&rsquo;s shape from the low, horizontal new building, and roughed it up a bit to make sure the pirate mentality of the scrappy entreprenuers who work at Strongbox came through. The options our team presented to the client had a handmade, DIY feel.

## The Outcome
Strongbox West selected three logos to use on their various channels. Co-founder Amy Hoover said, &ldquo;The Nine Labs team took the time to ask questions and really understand our brand and its goals. We were presented with a variety of options and were able to work with the designers to get a finished product we were happy with in our hands quickly and efficiently.&rdquo;
