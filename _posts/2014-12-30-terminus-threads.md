Terminus Threads offers handmade goods for the modern Southerner: pocket squares and table napkins stitched from samples and remnants from the high-fashion industry.

They&rsquo;re made in small batches right here in Atlanta, and when a fabric is gone, it&rsquo;s really gone. The upcycled approach keeps the cost low, so you can enjoy high-quality products without the high-end price tag.

## The Situation
Terminus Threads was a brand new venture, so they needed a website built from the ground up. This included a brand concept, logo design, tagline, website copy, and even physical packaging for the products.

## The Solution
Due to the exclusive nature of the products, it was important to indicate the stock remaining on the product page. We used Shopify as the e-commerce tool to implement this feature.

The company&rsquo;s team found an picture of a phoenix that they liked, and we re-created the image from scratch to serve as the logo.

Given the customer profile they had in mind, the entire brand concept and all of the web copy were geared toward anyone looking for a unique product to help them stand out. The site was designed to tell the brand&rsquo;s story with words and pictures.

## The Outcome
With its new polished image, this cottage industry was able to come to fruition and move from the garage to the virtual world of the Web. People are able to access goods that make them happy, and the company is able to focus on making the product, which is what they do best.
