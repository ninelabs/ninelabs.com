Termius Threads offers handmade goods for the modern Southerner: pocket squares and table napkins stitched from samples and remnants from the high-fashion industry. They're made in small batches right here in Atlanta, and when a fabric is gone, it's really gone. The upcycled approach keeps the cost low, so you can enjoy high-quality products without the high-end price tage.

## The Situation
Terminus Threads was a brand new venture, so they needed a website built from the ground up. This included a brand concept, logo design, tagline, website copy, and even physical packaging for the products.

## The Solution
We started the project as a Squarespace website, but after an initial evaluation we switched to Shopify. Given the exclusive nature of Terminus Threads' products, it was important that we could indicate the stock remaining on the product page, and that wasn't an available feature with Squarespace.

For the logo, the company's team found an existing picture of a phoenix that they liked, and [Jason](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/jason-ottinger/7/357/413) re-created the image from scratch. 

We handled the entire brand concept and focused copy for the site to appeal to the customer profile we had in mind: anyone looking for a polished product that would help them stand out. We worked hard to tell the brand's story with words and pictures.

## The Outcome
We enabled this cottage industry to come to fruition and move from the garage to the virtual world of the Web. People are able to access goods that make them happy, and the company is able to focus on making the product, which is what they do best.
