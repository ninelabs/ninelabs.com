title: How We Bill

This is one of the single most important discussions we can have. Nothing can ruin a project or a relationship faster than squabbles over money. It&rsquo;s always best to agree on a budget (and what may affect changes to it) before starting a project.

### We Don&rsquo;t Like Billing Hourly
Attorneys bill hourly, usually with no end in sight. Nobody likes to get bills from their attorney. We don&rsquo;t want to suck like that.

We believe in clear, project-based budgets. This removes the unknowns and gives you cost certainty. There&rsquo;s nothing worse than an open-ended and ambiguous financial commitment. We wouldn&rsquo;t sign up for one, so we don&rsquo;t ask you to.

### A Better Way

#### We&rsquo;re rewarded to work quickly.
When someone bills hourly they are incentivized to bill as many hours as possible. Billing on value incentivises us to work as quickly as possible to maximize our profits. This is also great for you because it means your project gets done faster.

#### You get a clear return on investment.
You know what you&rsquo;re spending and can see a clear result of the work. This makes it easier to justify the cost and predict the rewards.

### Options to Suit Your Needs

We work in one of three ways: [Short Term](/short-term/), on a project basis, or in a retainer based relationship. What&rsquo;s the difference? Glad you asked.

#### Project Based Budgets
Most projects have a clear start and end. You know where you are and where you want to be. Through a discovery phase we work with you to define the scope of a project, it&rsquo;s timeline and budget.

Once we agree on the project budget and timeline everyone one the team knows what to expect. From there we generally bill in three or four installments based on the project size a duration. For most projects we collect 50% up front as the [deposit](/notes/deposits.html), 25% at the midway point, and 25% at the end point.

#### Retainer Relationships
Some work is evergreen, always evolving, or simply too large to try to contain in a single project. In these cases it makes more sense to setup a retainer relationship where we dedicate a predefined amount of time and effort to your team for a fixed fee on a monthly basis. You get cost certainty and the comfort of knowing we&rsquo;re there to help.

For retainers we invoice the first month&rsquo;s retainer as the deposit and immediately send the invoice for the 2nd month on Net 15 terms so that the payment arrives ahead of the month for which it&rsquo;s due.

### Clarity is Good For Everyone
Being open and transparent about our billing practices helps make a difficult conversation easier. It&rsquo;s part of our core belief that working together is best when it&rsquo;s friendly and collaborative. The way it should be.
