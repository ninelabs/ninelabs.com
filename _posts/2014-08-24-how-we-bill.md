# How we bill.

This is one of the most important discussions we can have. We prefer to bill based on value. Why? Simple. It's clear, it's measurable, and it's better for you.

* **There is a clear budget.** This removes the unknowns and gives you cost certainty.
* **We're rewarded to work quickly.** When someone bills hourly they are incentivized to bill as many hours as possible. Billing on value incentivises us to work as quickly as possible to maximize our profits. This is also great for you because it means your project gets done faster.
* **You get a clear return on investment.** You know what you're spending and can see a clear result of the work. This makes it easier to justify the cost and predict the rewards.

Think of it this way. Nobody likes to get a bill from their attorney. Attorneys bill hourly. We don't want to suck like that.
