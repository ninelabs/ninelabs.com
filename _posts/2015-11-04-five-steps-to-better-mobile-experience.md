A few months ago, I accidently left my iPhone at home when I headed out for the day. When I realized it wasn’t in my car I immediately felt like I was missing a limb. I turned around and drove almost 20 minutes back to the house to grab it. I don’t say this with pride, but I do say it honestly. _Life without my iPhone would be very difficult_.

### And I'm not alone
Tens of millions of Americans and other citizens of the world feel the same way. We are obsessed with, even addicted to, our mobile devices.

Our phones and tablets can pay our bills, handle our schedules, make our phone calls, and even entertain us. Now, if only it could do my laundry...

Research shows online shoppers are using mobile devices to make purchases at a rapidly accelerating rate. As a result of this shift, savvy digital designers are realizing that they must consider mobile commerce a hugely critical part of their overall web design process.

If a website’s mobile experience isn’t clean, clear, and easy to navigate, chances are good that customers will go elsewhere, resulting in profit loss and lack of brand loyalty.

### How Can You Avoid Screwing Up Your Mobile Shopping Experience?

It's all about respect. You have to show that you respect your customers' time and money. But how? Here are 5 things to keep in mind when designing your mobile experience:

#### 1. RESPECT THE CLOCK
Life moves fast, and so should your mobile experience. Here are some startling numbers:

  - A _one-second delay_ in page response can _reduce conversion_ by up to 7%
  - 47% of users expect pages to load in two seconds.
  - 40% say they’ll leave a site if load time exceeds three seconds
  - 79% are less likely to use the site again when faced with response delays.

It’s apparent that lengthy loading times will affect a company’s bottom line. This won’t fly in today’s uber-competitive marketplace.

#### 2. RESPECT THE FINGER
If your mobile site or app contains microscopic text and is crammed edge-to-edge with content, links, and pictures, even the world’s tiniest fingers won’t be able to tap what they want without error. Frustrated customers will be short-term customers, and in a world where customer loyalty is directly related to profit, this just won’t do. Give your users a clean and uncluttered interface with large touch-targets and they’ll thank you for it every time they tap.

#### 3. RESPECT THE CODE
The code used to create websites has come a long way since the early days of the Internet. Back in 1996, all we had was a gray background, black text, and blue links. Now we can do really smart things like make the numeric keypad appear instead of the QWERTY alternative when someone is entering a number into a form. Websites and app should always take advantage of the most current coding practices so they are as easy to use as possible.

#### 4. RESPECT THE SCREEN
Hick’s Law describes the time it takes for a person to make a decision as a result of the possible choices he or she has. The more choices offered, the longer it takes for said person to make a decision. 48% of people say they’ve left a website that had a product they wanted due to an overabundance of options. More than a few things on the screen at once can paralyze your user. Don’t overload them with too many choices at once.

#### 5. RESPECT THE PROCESS
There’s no need to reinvent the wheel. Use tried-and-true processes that yield consistent, positive outcomes and growth in sales. When it’s time to explore new digital horizons, forge the mobile e-commerce trail in a way that directly lines up with the needs and desires of the customer, thinking with the mind of your target buyer.

### IN CONCLUSION...

The e-commerce industry would do well to pause for a moment and remember this truth: the future is going to run on mobile devices. iPhones/androids and iPads/other tablets are only going to increase in popularity. Business leaders and designers alike must consider the mobile e-commerce experience to be a priority; if they make online shopping enjoyable and easy for the smartphone or tablet customer, it will impact their bottom lines in a lucrative way.
