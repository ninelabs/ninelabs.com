Here we are. We've started on the basis for the new AWDG website. But don&rsquo;t get excited. It's not the final design! It&rsquo;s just something we put together to serve as a placeholder for updates and other info while the website is being made.

So what&rsquo;s happening here? We put together a quick [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) website hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com). We&rsquo;ve used [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) to get things up and running quickly. Feel free to [have a look at the code](https://github.com/AWDG/awdg.org).

The [Speaker Application](/speak/) and [Become a Sponsor](/sponsor/) forms are powered by Wufoo, and the [Join the Group](/join/) form is hooked up to our Mailchimp account (which we&rsquo;ll use as the basis for our membership database).


### Wait a sec. Who&rsquo;s doing this?

As we said in the [Kickstarter Campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jcornelius/official-awdg-website), we&rsquo;re running this like a regular client project (except that we&rsquo;re posting a lot of details to the public), so the team at Nine Labs is leading the charge.

We have [J Cornelius](https://twitter.com/jc) as Project Manager, [Brad Weaver](https://twitter.com/sbradweaver) as UX and Creative Lead, [Moses Ngone](https://twitter.com/mospired) as Technical Lead, and [Jason Ottinger](https://twitter.com/jottin) as Design Lead.

Want to help out? Great! We&rsquo;ll certainly need help as things move along. [Send me an email](mailto:jc@awdg.org) with your skills and what you&rsquo;d like to do to help.

## Sketching Things Out
Here are a few sketches Brad has been working on showing various ideas for how the home page, events list, and profile page might lay out.
