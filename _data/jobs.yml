    Are you a pretty kick-ass front-end developer who enjoys working on well-scoped projects? Read on&hellip;

    The work is some Wordpress, some Squarespace, some plain-ole HTML/CSS/JS hotness. You can work from home or from our offices in West Midtown.

    There are several projects; all are well defined with a designer on the team to handle the heavy lifting on visuals and an engineer to handle the details of implementation. Your job will be focused on delivering lean, quality code and working with the rest of the team through the process of making it all live and delivering to the clients.

    - You know WooCommerce like the back of your hand
    - You are experienced working with basic PHP tasks
    - You’re a dab hand in JavaScript/jQuery (If you can write plugins as well then that’s a bonus, but you must be able to write and implement small-to-medium scripts at least)
    - You’re an old pro in writing raw HTML and CSS (especially HTML5 and CSS3)
    - You’re used to developing in a LAMP environment
    - You’re on-the-button with current Web standards, optimization techniques and best practices
