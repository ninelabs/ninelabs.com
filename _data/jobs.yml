    Do you love networking? Are you great at winning friends and influencing people? We're looking for someone to spread the word about who we are and what we do.

    You'll need a solid understanding of what we do and why it matters so you can answer questions on the fly while working the room at a mixer or on the phone with a prospect. You'll need to be able to do market research to identify potential clients and be charming enough to get a meeting with them. Most of your time will be out of the office, but you'll have a desk in our West Midtown office when you want it.

    Sound like something you're great at? Sweet. [Send us a nicely worded email](mailto:hello@ninelabs.com) explaining why you're the best person for the job. If we agree, we'll reply and set up a time to meet.
