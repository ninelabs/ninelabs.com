    If J knows one thing, it&rsquo;s how business works on the Web. His background is in software design, user experience, and making companies more efficient through technology. He started his first company in high school, sold it, then joined [CoffeeCup Software](http://www.coffeecup.com), where he helped steer the company from fledgling startup to web design software powerhouse serving over 500MM users around the globe.

    After moving back to Atlanta in 2008, he founded the [Atlanta Web Design Group](http://www.awdg.org), which now has over 3,000 members throught the Atlanta Metro Area. He is a mentor at the [Advanced Technology Development Center](http://www.atdc.org) at Georgia Tech (Go Jackets!), a lecturer at the University of Georgia&rsquo;s Terry School of Business (Go Dawgs!), and has served as an advisor to the computer science department at Texas A&M University (don&rsquo;t mess with Texas). He&rsquo;s been a private consultant to numerous other enterprises and organizations (read more on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jcornelius)) and has spoken at events across the country on topics from software development methodologies to the psychology of customer experience.

    He&rsquo;s passionate about efficient, usable, aesthetically pleasing design, and exceptional service. He has impeccable taste when it comes to whisky and thai food (but not at the same time). Away from the computer, you might find him grilling a steak, walking his dog, or making pocket squares. If he could have one superpower it would be time travel.

    Brad&rsquo;s got an eye for design. A User Experience generalist, his background includes product development, interactive, branding, and market segmentation. He can design your graphics, optimize for user experience, code the front-end of your website, or lay out your iOS application. He&rsquo;s worked with big name clients like MTV, AT&T, ESPN, Disney, Columbia Records, NATO, The PGA, Coca-Cola, UnitedHealth Group, Macy&rsquo;s, and Hard Rock Caf√©, but he&rsquo;s also folded clothes, pumped gas, bagged groceries, and sold cell phones.

    As the CEO and Creative Director of Suckerpunch Studios, which he founded, Brad worked collaboratively with clients to solve business marketing challenges. Previously, he served as the Online Media Manager and Product Branding specialist for Verizon Wireless and did Visual Merchandising for American Eagle. His book, Creative Truth, releases fall 2015 from Focal Press. There&rsquo;s more on LinkedIn!

    He&rsquo;s a big fan of minimal design, Scotch, and Oxford commas. He&rsquo;s known for his loquaciousness and his barbeque sauce. When he&rsquo;s not in front of a whiteboard, sketch pad, or monitor, you might stumble across Brad in the middle of the movie you&rsquo;re watching. His superpower, naturally, would be mind-reading.

  bio: |
    Moses may be a laid-back guy, but his code works overtime at solving your problems. He&rsquo;s got a plethora of technologies at his disposal, from PHP to JavaScript (vanilla, Node, and more) to MongoDB. Mo truly understands the connection between software and business, and he&rsquo;s got a knack for spotting a problem, understanding it to the nth degree, and applying technology to solve it.

    An entrepreneur at heart, Mo&rsquo;s got business-savvy. He worked at Cengage Learning for 10 years through three buyouts and progressed from Tech Support to Senior PHP Engineer. With that experience under his belt, he established a consulting firm, Mospired, and worked with clients including Sharecare, OnCourse Learning, and Epic Labs. He&rsquo;s an ardent supporter of the local tech community and has spoken at the Atlanta PHP Meetup Group, the Atlanta Web Design Group, and the Atlanta JavaScript Meetup Group, as well as various regional meetups and conferences, on topics as diverse as application architecture, mobile development, and package management.

    Mo&rsquo;s a Gooner who cheers on the Arsenal Football Club. When he&rsquo;s not architecting elegant software solutions, he&rsquo;s probably cooking (he likes things spicy!) or driving to the mountains. His superpower would be teleportation, preferably over HTTP.
