  bio: |
    He designs, he codes, he writes, he UXs, he slices and dices.

    Brad went to school to be a lawyer, then he came to his senses and has spent the last 15 years as a UX generalist with a geek&rsquo;s heart of gold. His experience includes product development, interactive, branding, and market segmentation. He's been the big cheese, the plebeian, the middle manager, and the class clown. He's also folded clothes, pumped gas, bagged groceries, sold cell phones, and climbed the Great Wall of China. He likes beer, scotch, Oxford commas, and Jesus, but not in that order.

  bio: |
    After many years curating code for the likes of Cengage and Sharecare, he took the leap and created his solo consultancy Mospired while managing projects at Epic Labs. When not at the office, Mo loves sharing ideas and giving back to the community. As an active member of Atlanta web community, he participates and speaks on various topics related to web development. On any given weekend he is glued to the screen fueling his "fanhood" of the Arsenal Football Club (Gunners) and or looking out for the ever elusive super car. Ask him about it.
