    If J knows one thing, it&rsquo;s how business works on the Web. His background is in software design, user experience, and making companies more efficient through technology. Hestarted his first company in high school, sold it, then, then joined [CoffeeCup Software](http://www.coffeecup.com), where he helped steer the company from fledgling startup to web design software powerhouse serving over 500MM users around the globe.

    After moving back to Atlanta in 2008, he founded the [Atlanta Web Design Group](http://www.awdg.org), which now has over 3,000 members throught the Atlanta Metro Area. He is a mentor at the [Advanced Technology Development Center](http://www.atdc.org) at Georgia Tech (Go Jackets!), a lecturer at the University of Georgia&rsquo;s Terry School of Business (Go Dawgs!), and has served as an advisor to the computer science department at Texas A&M University (don&rsquo;t mess with Texas). He&rsquo;s been a private consultant to numerous other enterprises and organizations (read more on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jcornelius)) and has spoken at events across the country on topics from software development methodologies to the psychology of customer experience.

    He&rsquo;s passionate about efficient, usable, aesthetically pleasing design, and exceptional service. He has impeccable taste when it comes to whisky and thai food (but not at the same time). Away from the computer, you might find him grilling a steak, walking his dog, or making pocket squares. If he could have one superpower it would be time travel.

    He designs, he codes, he writes, he UXs, he slices and dices.

    Brad went to school to be a lawyer, then he came to his senses and has spent the last 15 years as a UX generalist with a geek&rsquo;s heart of gold. His experience includes product development, interactive, branding, and market segmentation. He&rsquo;s been the big cheese, the plebeian, the middle manager, and the class clown. He&rsquo;s also folded clothes, pumped gas, bagged groceries, sold cell phones, and climbed the Great Wall of China. He likes beer, scotch, Oxford commas, and Jesus, but not in that order.

  bio: |
    After many years curating code for the likes of Cengage and Sharecare, he took the leap and created his solo consultancy Mospired while managing projects at Epic Labs. When not at the office, Mo loves sharing ideas and giving back to the community. As an active member of Atlanta web community, he participates and speaks on various topics related to web development. On any given weekend he is glued to the screen fueling his "fanhood" of the Arsenal Football Club (Gunners) and or looking out for the ever elusive super car. Ask him about it.
