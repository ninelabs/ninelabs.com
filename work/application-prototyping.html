    <p>When you have an app idea, the urge to launch a caffiene-fueled rush to the app store is strong. But if you&rsquo;re serious about your business, you need to slow down. Creating and testing a prototype is a key step.</p>
    <h3>Car Companies Build Models. So Should You.</h3>
    <p>A prototype is a version of your app that you can show to people and test in the leanest (i.e. the least time and budget) way possible. It&rsquo;s similar to the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) we all know from the “Lean Startup” movement. But unlike a MVP, you&rsquo;ll be able to test a prototype with real people before putting all the effort (and money) into building the real thing.</p>
    <h4>Basic Prototyping</h4>
    <p>While building a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) can easily cost up to six figures, you can get an interactive prototype for as little as $10,000.</p>

        <p>When we hired Nine Labs, our project had stalled out with another firm.  The team at Nine Labs took the time to understand our brand and our vision. They delivered a customized website in the promised timeframe. Thanks, Nine Labs!</p>

        <p>They took the time to ask questions and really understand our brand and its goals. We were able to work with them to get a finished product quickly and efficiently. I loved working with the whole team. They&rsquo;re fun and listened to what I needed. Top notch firm.</p>
