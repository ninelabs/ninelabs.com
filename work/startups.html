    <h4>What do Uber, AirBNB, Instagram, and other successful startups have in common?</h4>
    <p class="standout">Great Design.</p>
    <p>They understand that great design is a strategic weapon. From the very beginning, the founders of these companies knew they had to nail the <em>first impression</em>.</p>
    <p>Everyone from first-time users to Venture Capitalists will judge your company in milliseconds. You need your digital properties to put your company's best foot forward to everyone that meets you. Great design will give you confidence.</p>
    <p>The difference between people just using your product once and people falling in love with it is no accident. It&rsquo;s the result of well-thought-out, strategic design decisions.</p>

          <q>It can be difficult with a small startup team to put together a cohesive strategy. We brought on the Nine Labs team for a project that was small in scope but had a big impact on our company. It took our branding to the next level and really highlighted the feel of our company. The team was great to work with--efficient, communicative, and invested in our success.</q>
