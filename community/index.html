      <h1>We Care About Community</h1>

  <p class="lead">We believe the Web should help make the world a better place for everyone. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re very involved with the local community.</p>
  <p>Part of being a good citizen is helping others. Our way of helping is by providing leadership and resources to the local community through hosting regular meetups, events, and workshops.</p>
  <p>We&rsquo;re fortunate enough to know a lot of great people in this business, so we invite them to come share their knowledge to help bolster the skills of the community.</p>
  <p>Atlanta is rapidly becoming <em>the hub</em> for technology and digital creativity of the South, and we&rsquo;re happy to be helping it get there.</p>

      <h3>Web Afternoon</h3>
      <p>The AWDG community expressed a thirst for more than single-speaker events, so we created one. Web Afternoon is a single-track event focused on bringing thought leaders to the local community in a setting which encourages interaction and inspiration.</p>
      <p>There have been four events in Atlanta, and several others in Charlotte, Charleston, and Augusta.</p>

      <h3>Polygon</h3>
      <p>One of the main struggles with any community is finding a stable, low-cost meeting place. Atlanta was no different. A number of groups expressed their need for a good place to have their events, so we opened one.</p>
      <p>Polygon is a 2,300 sq. ft. meeting and event space located right in the heart of the city. It has fantastic a audio/video setup, plentiful low-cost parking, and is just a few steps from every amenity you could want.</p>
      <p>Since opening in October 2014 we&rsquo;ve held over 150 events and hosted over 3,000 people, giving the local tech and creative community a place to call home.</p>
