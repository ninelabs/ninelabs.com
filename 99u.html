  <p>For the first time ever, during the week of September 14th to 18th, <a href="http://99u.com/local">28 hand-picked cities</a> from around the world will be hosting their own free, one-night-only 99U Local event. And we've secured the rights to make Atlanta is one of them.</p>
  <p>This is not a conference. It is a casual, intimate, local 99U style experience in your city. The event will consist of three curated talks that share road-tested insights on making ideas happen followed by a casual networking and drinks session.</p>
