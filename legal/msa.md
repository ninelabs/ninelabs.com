**Client: _________________________________________________**

These terms will apply to the relationship between us (NoveLaboratori, LLC d/b/a Nine Labs) and you, the above-identified client:

1. *Professional Services:* We will perform all actions that, according to our reasonable judgment, are necessary for us to complete the projects set forth in this agreement and any other subsequently executed Proposal or Statement of Work.
1. *Deposit:* You will pay us a deposit of $____________________, which will be applied toward our fees and expenses under this agreement.
1. *Fees:* For project based engagements you will be invoiced for all fees as outlined in each respective project&rsquo;s Proposal or Statement of Work. For retainer engagements you will be invoiced at the beginning of each calendar month for the services to be provided in that month (pay in advance).
  1. *Travel:* You will be charged a flat fee of $300 per day per staff member – in addition to regular charges – for each day or part thereof that we, upon your request, are traveling to and from or working from a location that is more than 50 miles away from our office.
1. *Expenses:* Other than travel costs, we will be responsible for all of our out-of-pocket expenses (e.g., supplies, administrative costs, etc.) associated with our providing our services under this agreement. You will be invoiced for all out-of-pocket expenses associated with our travel to and from locations away from our office.
1. *Initial Payment &amp; Invoices:* We will not begin work under this agreement until we receive the initial payment that is due upon the execution of this agreement and any other Proposal or Statement of Work executed between us. If we do not receive the initial payment within 14 days, this agreement will be void. After we receive the initial payment, we will invoice you when our fees become due and payable. You will be charged interest at the rate of 1 &frac12; % per month for any balance that remains unpaid for more than 30 days beyond the date of our invoice, to the extent that the law allows. We reserve the right to postpone or defer additional services or to discontinue our work if our fees are not paid within 15 days of the due date of our invoice.
1. *Estimates Not Binding:* Because of the unique nature of what we do, except in simple matters, it is usually impossible to foresee how much time and expense will be involved in completing a particular project. Any estimates or budgets that we project are always subject to adjusting as circumstances change, so they are not binding.
1. *Acceptance:* We will notify you when we have completed each portion of the work set out in the Proposal or Statement of Work, each portion being a &ldquo;Deliverable.&rdquo; For each Deliverable that requires your approval, you will notify us in writing within five business days following delivery of a Deliverable whether you accept or reject the Deliverable. Your failure to respond within that period will be considered to be its acceptance of the Deliverable. You will accept each Deliverable when you determines that it conforms to the relevant specifications. You will not unreasonably reject any Deliverable. If you reject a Deliverable, you will give us written notice of the deficiencies existing or improvements or modifications needed consistent with the specifications. We will then remedy the deficiencies or make the recommended improvement or modification and resubmit the Deliverable to you for an additional five-business-day period of examination and testing. This process will be repeated until the Deliverable is accepted.
1. *Modifications to Specifications:* If you want to modify the specifications for the work to be performed under this agreement, the following procedure will apply:
  1. You will give us a written request for modifications that sets forth the changes you want to make to the specifications for the work to be performed under this agreement.
  1. Within five business days of receiving your request, we will provide you with a written notice setting forth any of the following that apply with respect to the proposed changes:
      1. technical difficulties;
      1. price changes (including any revisions in the payment schedules); and
      1. schedule changes
  1. You will have five business days after receiving our response to provide us with written notice that you want to go forward with the modifications, in which event this agreement will be considered to be automatically amended to incorporate the changes to the specifications for the work to be performed, deadlines for Deliverables, the Development Fee, and the compensation schedule as detailed in the requests and notices provided and sent in accordance with this section of this agreement. If you elect not to go forward with the modifications, then all remaining deadlines for performance contained in this agreement will be extended by 10 business days. Your failure to notify us that you wish to go forward with the modifications will be considered to be the equivalent of you electing not to go forward with the modifications.
1. *Termination:* You may terminate our services at any time by giving us notice of your decision. You will still be obligated to pay for all services rendered and expenses incurred on your behalf up to the time of termination, as well as any fees or expenses that are reasonably necessary afterward. We may terminate our engagement with you by giving you at least 30 days&rsquo; notice.
1. *Proprietary Rights:*
  1. *Original Work:* Except as may be specified elsewhere in this agreement or where we otherwise notify you in writing before beginning any work, all work that we will provide to you will be wholly original.
  1. *Open-Source and Licensed Software:* We may use and incorporate open-source and licensed software into work that we will provide to you. If we use licensed software in the work that we provide to you, we will take all actions necessary to assign to you the required licenses. If we are unable to assign the licenses to you, we will work with you to obtain (at your expense) the required licenses.
  1. *No Infringement:* The things that we will design or create for you will not infringe the copyright, patent, trademark, or trade-secret rights of any other party.
  1. *All Proprietary Rights Assigned to You:* All proprietary rights in the things that we design or create for you will automatically be assigned to you upon payment of all sums due under this agreement, and you will then own all rights in the things that we design or create for you, including all patents, copyrights, trademarks, and other proprietary rights. In this regard, upon payment of all sums due under this agreement, we irrevocably assign to you all proprietary rights in the things that we will design or create for you. The rights transferred by this assignment are transferred in perpetuity and apply throughout the universe and to all media and channels of distribution now known or that may be developed in the future.
  1. *Waiver of &ldquo;Moral&rdquo; Rights:* We expressly waive any so-called &ldquo;moral&rdquo; rights or author&rsquo;s similar rights, including any right to restrict you from changing any of the material that we design or create for you, and any rights to attribution or credit.
  1. *Executing Documents:* We will execute all documents reasonably requested by you that are necessary to further document our assignment to you of all proprietary rights in the things that we design or create for you.
1. *Confidentiality:*
  1. *Your Confidential Information:* When used in this agreement, &ldquo;your confidential information&rdquo; or &ldquo;confidential information&rdquo; means all information provided to us by you except information that:
      1. is made freely available by you to your clients generally or is published or otherwise made available to the public through sources entitled to disclose the information;
      1. is or becomes known to the public through no fault of our own;
      1. is known to us before we receive the information from you; or
      1. becomes known to us through disclosures by a third party that we reasonably believe in good faith is entitled to disclose it.
  By way of example and not limitation, your confidential information includes but is not limited to the identities of your clients and vendors; the terms of your agreements with your clients and vendors, including the prices you charge your clients; proposals you have made to your clients and prospective clients; your marketing plans and strategies; your business plans, and financial information relating to your operations, including your charging methodologies, billings, revenues, expenses, and profits.
  1. *Duty of Confidentiality:* Except as you may expressly permit in writing or as may be required in the normal conduct of our duties providing services to you or working on your behalf, we will not use in any way or disclose any of your confidential information to anyone not employed by you. With respect to the portions of your confidential information that are not trade secrets under applicable law, this duty of confidentiality will expire five years from the date that we last provide services to you or work on your behalf. With respect to the portions of your confidential information that are trade secrets, this duty of confidentiality will apply for as long as the information does not become generally known through legitimate means.
  1. *Duties If Legally-Compelled Disclosure Is Sought:* If we receive a subpoena or other validly issued administrative or judicial process that requests that we disclose any of your confidential information, we will—to the extent not prohibited by law—promptly notify you and tender to you the defense of the demand. If requested by you, we will cooperate with and assist you (at your expense) in seeking to have the demand limited, quashed, or extended.
  1. *Return and Destruction of Confidential Information:* We will return your confidential information to you upon your request. We will also return your confidential information to you when we stop providing services to you or working on your behalf. Also upon your request or when we stop providing services to you or working on your behalf, we will destroy or erase any copies of your confidential information that is stored on computer hardware or any other storage devices or media that we own or control. We will ensure that the destruction or erasure will conform to a standard no less stringent than the U.S. Department of Defense Standard 5220.22-M for clearing and sanitizing as it may be amended or restated from time to time.
1. *Subcontractors:* We may engage subcontractors to perform portions of our services or work. We will not engage a subcontractor to perform our services or work for you without the subcontractor agreeing in writing that all services performed by the subcontractor are on a &ldquo;work made for hire&rdquo; basis and are wholly owned by us, and to the extent any element created by the subcontractor does not constitute a &ldquo;work made for hire&rdquo; under applicable law, that the subcontractor assigns all elements the subcontractor creates to us. We will remain solely responsible to you for all work performed by any subcontractor and for the payment of all subcontractors. Furthermore, we agree that any payment or fee payable to a subcontractor is included in the payments and fees to be made to us under this agreement.
1. *Warranties:*
  1. *Correcting Deficiencies.* We will correct within a reasonable amount of time any deficiencies in our work reported within 30 days of being accepted by you. We will not be obligated to correct deficiencies if they are caused by any changes, alterations, or modifications made to the work or related systems by you or an independent contractor that you may subsequently hire.
  1. *NO OTHER WARRANTIES* EXCEPT AS MAY BE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS AGREEMENT, WE EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE. WE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF DESIGN, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. WE MAKE NO WARRANTY AS TO THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF MATERIAL THAT WE MAY CREATE FOR YOU. EXCEPT AS MAY BE OTHERWISE SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE MATERIAL THAT WE CREATE FOR YOU WILL BE PROVIDED STRICTLY ON AN &ldquo;AS-IS&rdquo; BASIS.
1. *Indemnification*
  1. *Indemnification by Us* We will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless you from and against all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, and expenses, including reasonable attorney&rsquo;s fees, imposed upon, incurred by, or asserted against you and your successors and assigns that relate to or arise out of any third- party claim brought against you alleging that the website we designed for you infringes a patent, copyright, or trademark of any person. This indemnification provision does not cover the website&rsquo;s content that is provided to us by you.
  1. *Indemnification by You* You will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless us from and against all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, and expenses, including reasonable attorney&rsquo;s fees, imposed upon, incurred by, or asserted against us and our successors and assigns that relate to or arise out of any third- party claim brought against us concerning the content of the website that you gave us to incorporate for incorporation into the website.
1. *Limitation of Liability:*
  1. EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES PAYABLE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ANY OF OUR INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, OUR ENTIRE LIABILITY FOR ALL CAUSES OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, OR IN TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), FOR ANY CLAIMS RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ITS PERFORMANCE IS LIMITED IN THE AGGREGATE TO THE TOTAL FEES PAID BY YOU TO US UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

EXCEPT FOR DAMAGES PAYABLE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ANY OF OUR INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, IN NO EVENT WILL WE BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUE, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF OR COULD HAVE REASONABLY FORESEEN THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY FAILURE TO REALIZE EXPECTED SAVINGS.
1. *Nonsolicitation of our Employees or Subcontractors:* While we are providing services to you or working on your behalf, you will not—either directly or indirectly— solicit for employment, employ, or retain the services of anyone who is or was employed by or under contract with us during the time we are providing services to you or working on your behalf. Also, for the first year after we stop providing services to you or working on your behalf, you will not—either directly or indirectly—solicit for employment, employ, or retain the services of anyone who was employed by or under contract with us during the time we are providing services to you or working on your behalf.
1. *Time is of the Essence:* Time is of the essence of this agreement.
1. *Force Majeure:* If either party is delayed from performing any of its obligations under this agreement due to causes entirely beyond its control such as riots, insurrections, martial law, civil commotion, war, fire, flood, earthquake, or other casualty or acts of God, the performance of the obligation so hindered will be excused for the period of delay, and the time for performance will be extended by the same number of days in the period of delay.
1. *Notices:* Notices required to be made under this agreement must be made in writing and either personally delivered, mailed through the United States Postal Service or other governmental postal service, or sent through a commercial firm that is regularly engaged in the business of document delivery or document and package delivery.

It is the obligation of the party sending the notice to verify and retain evidence that the postal service or delivery firm delivered the notice. The notice will be effective the date the notice was delivered. All notices and all related correspondence must be sent to the addresses set forth at the end of this agreement, or to such other addresses as the parties may direct by written notice.
1. *Assignment:* A party may assign its rights and duties under this agreement to a third party that buys all or substantially all of the assets of that party. To be effective, the party seeking to assign its rights and duties under this agreement to a third party must assign all of its rights and duties under this agreement to that third party, and the assigning party must give the non-assigning party written notice of the assignment. Any assignment will not, however, relieve the assigning party of its duties under this agreement. Except as provided above, neither party can assign or delegate its rights or duties under this agreement to anyone. Any attempt to do so will be considered to be void.
1. *No Waiver:* If at any time either party does not insist that the other strictly comply with any provision of this agreement, that will not waive the party&rsquo;s right to require the other to strictly comply with that provision, or any other provision, in the future.
1. *Collection Costs:* If we have to collect on your account, you will pay for all collection costs, including reasonable attorney&rsquo;s fees.
1. *Third-Party-Initiated Proceedings and Activities:* If any claim is brought against us or any of our personnel or subcontractors based on your alleged negligence or misconduct, if we or any of our personnel or subcontractors are asked to testify or produce documents as a result of providing services to you or working on your behalf, or if we or any of our personnel or subcontractors must defend the confidentiality of your confidential information in any proceeding, you will pay us for any resulting costs incurred by us or any of our personnel or subcontractors. This includes paying us the attorney&rsquo;s fees that we or our personnel or subcontractors incur, and for our personnel&rsquo;s and subcontractors&rsquo; time. The charges for our personnel&rsquo;s and our subcontractors&rsquo; time charged under this provision will be calculated at the hourly rate of $165 per hour.
