  <p class="lead">There are times when you need a little help without a big commitment. We get that. Our small batch sessions are perfect for those times.</p>

  <h3>What&rsquo;s Included</h3>
  <p>You get full use of our skills to help with your situation. One of <a href="/experience/">our Partners</a> &mdash; J, Brad, or Moses (depending on skills required) &mdash; will be available to you and your team for the amount of time you choose. At the end of the session all work generated during that session is yours to keep and use however you like.</p>

  <h3>What can we accomplish?</h3>
  <p>We can talk about Brand Strategy, User Experience Design and Strategy, User Interface Design, Information Architecture, technical systems integration, project scoping, workflow improvement, application ideation, or whatever you feel we can help you with.</p>

          <p>J is everything that&rsquo;s right with the web industry. Professional, knowledgable and smart as hell. On top of that he has the ability to make people want to be a part of whatever he&rsquo;s working on. Any client would be lucky to have J leading their team.</p>

  <h3>These sessions are a great way to:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Help define scope and scale for a new project</li>
    <li>Jump start a new project</li>
    <li>Get extra short-term horsepower on an existing project</li>
    <li>Get a second opinion on something you&rsquo;re struggling with</li>
    <li>Simply test out how we work together before committing to a larger project</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Rates</h3>
  <p>Rates depend on how many of our Partners you&rsquo;d like to have in the session. If you&rsquo;re looking for something more intense or involved than two Partners for a week, we should talk about a project based or retainer relationship instead.</p>
