## The Situation
Strongbox West, Atlanta's original coworking spot, had outgrown their building. Moving from 9,000 sq. ft. to over 44,000 sq. ft. is a major upgrade, and they wanted to upgrade their identity along with their digs. So, they approached us to come up with a new logo.

## The Solution
Director of Design Brad Weaver worked with the Strongbox West team to develop a new brand direction. The old logo reflected the industrial feel of the coworking space, but it needed to be modernized. We took inspiration for the logo's shape from the low, horizontal new building, and roughed it up a bit to make sure the pirate mentality of the scrappy entreprenuers who work at Strongbox came through. The options our team presented to the client had a handmade, DIY feel. 

## The Outcome
Strongbox West selected three logos to use on their various channels. Co-founder Amy Hoover appreciated that we took the time to ask questions, listen, and really understand the brand and its goals. This was a fun project for everyone involved, and we delivered the final project quickly and efficiently.
