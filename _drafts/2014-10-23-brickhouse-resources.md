Brickhouse Resources is an IT staffing company that loves people and their home in Atlanta, just like we do. They focus on personalized recruiting and hiring for the technology industry. Wendy Kemp and Larry Bruce both came from the corportate staffing world, and they are passionate and excited about implementing a relationship-driven strategy.

## The Situation
When we first spoke with Wendy and Larry, they were concerned about how their company was perceived online. They are dynamic people who feel that most recruiting websites are too sterile and lack personality. Yet the Brickhouse website simply didn&rsquo;t reflect their individualized recruiting strategy, as you can see in this archived snapshot.

## The Solution
We worked with Brickhouse to help them discover their voice. After working through several exercises, we landed on a casual yet lightheartedly direct way to tell their story. We listed out what emotions they wanted their website to evoke from visitors and determined what impression they wanted people to leave with. We rolled out a total website redesign, including content, front end design and development, and deployment.

## The Outcome
The new BrickhouseResources.com is bright and clean. We used photographs of their team as a background for the top menu bar to elicit a personal connection, and emphasized the personal even more with the slogan "We&rsquo;re People Driven." The site drives results, just like Wendy, Larry, and their team.

In Wendy&rsquo;s words, "When we hired Nine Labs, our project had stalled out with another firm.  The team at Nine Labs took the time to understand our brand and our vision.  They delivered a customized website in the promised timeframe.  Thanks Nine Labs!
