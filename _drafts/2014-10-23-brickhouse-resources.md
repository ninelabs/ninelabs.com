Brickhouse Resources is an IT staffing company that loves people and loves their home in Atlanta, just like we do. They focus on personalized recruiting and hiring for the technology industry. Wendy Kemp and Larry Bruce both came from the corportate staffing world, and they are passionate and excited about implementing a relationship-driven strategy. 

## The Situation
When we first spoke with Wendy and Larry, they were concerned about how their company was perceived online. They are dynamic people who feel that most recruiting websites are too sterile and lack personality. Yet the Brickhouse website simply didn't reflect their individualized recruiting strategy, as you can see in this archived snapshot.

## The Solution
We worked with Brickhouse to help them discover their voice, working through several exercises to land on a casual and lighthearted, yet direct, way to tell their story. We listed out what emotions they wanted their website to evoke from visitors, and determined what impression they wanted people to leave with. We rolled out a total website redesign, including content, front end design and development, and deployment.

## The Outcome
The new BrickhouseResources.com is bright and clean. We used a mixture of photographs as a background for the top menu bar to elicit a personal connection, and emphasized the personal even more with the slogan "We're People Driven." The site has a consistent color scheme and drives results, just like Brickhouse. 

Wendy told us that, as happens with many projects, their site redesign had stalled out prior to contacting Nine Labs. She thanked us for taking the time to understand their brand and vision, and for delivering the customized website in the promised timeframe. We take pride in our ability to highlight exactly the message our customers are hoping to deliver, and in doing so on time!
