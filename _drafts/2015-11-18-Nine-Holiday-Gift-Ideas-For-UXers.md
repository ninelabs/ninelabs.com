We’re excited for the holidays here at Nine Labs! The weather has finally started to get chilly, people around town seem to be smiling more, and there’s nothing like walking out of the cold and into the warmth of the mall after you just cut off a little old lady in an Oldsmobile to get the best parking spot (hypothetically speaking, of course). 

This time of year can be stressful. Which relative is staying with which family member? Who is hosting the holiday meal (and don’t forget Aunt Whitney is vegan!)? It’s difficult enough dealing with the togetherness the holidays can bring, let alone searching for and selecting exactly the right gift for that special someone. 

We know how tough it can be to find the perfect gift for the UXer in your life, and we’re here to help. Close that Jelly of the Month Club tab in your browser and look no further, because we’ve got you covered. Here are some of our team’s most favorite and coveted items:

####1. [Slicky Notes](http://www.ecostaticinc.com/product-category/shop/)
![]({{site.baseurl}}/http://www.ecostaticinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/4-x-4-5-Assort.-Image-1.jpg)
Sticky notes that stick to the wall without all the nasty residue because SCIENCE. If you visit the Nine Labs office space, you’ll see we’ve got tons of these guys stuck to the walls as well as to their Slickyboards. Both are great tools to have on hand, especially for those information-architecture projects that have you moving sticky notes around over long stretches of time. These sticky notes never lose their stick!

####2. [Moleskine](http://www.moleskine.com/us/)
![]({{site.baseurl}}/http://cdn.thejournalshop.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/m/o/moleskine-pocket-reporter-ruled/Moleskine-Pocket-Reporter-Notebook-Ruled-31.jpg)
Also affectionately referred to as Old Faithful. Our entire company loves Moleskine notebooks - not just our designers. We live in these things. They come in all kinds of shapes, sizes, and colors, and you’re bound to find a style that fits your favorite UXer.

####3. [The Disruptus Game](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BCE2DNA/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=2KM854ZUZ3DA4&coliid=I37RN9A5SLQJ90)
![]({{site.baseurl}}/http://funnybonetoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/d2.jpg)
Yes, it’s technically a game designed for children. However, it’s also one of the best tools we have to encourage creativity, have fun, and motivate our clients in discovery sessions. 

####4. [Whiskey Taxonomy Glasses](http://www.uncommongoods.com/product/whiskey-taxonomy-glass-set)
![]({{site.baseurl}}/http://www.uncommongoods.com/images/product/26125_zoom1.jpg)
What goes better with taxonomies than whiskey? We love it so much, we even created [a weekend getaway](https://webwhiskyweekend.com/WebWhisky/whiskey) around it!

####5. [Design & Thinking documentary](http://designthinkingmovie.com/#home)
![]({{site.baseurl}}/http://www.dot.org.au/assets/AGDA_Desgin_Thinking-Movie.jpg)
It's so good, you might even want to watch it with them!

####6. [The Use-Anywhere Whiteboard Notebook](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IFRD214/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00IFRD214&linkCode=as2&tag=marsha0d3-20&linkId=OIYIL6WWBKGB5VTV)
![]({{site.baseurl}}/https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/b3/19/a0/b319a0b297fb70a54a2ef5f15a1344b1.jpg)
It’s got whiteboard pages and clear vinyl pages, too! It's one of the coolest products out there.

####7. [Ziggi HD-Plus USB Document Camera](http://www.ipevo.com/prods/Ziggi-HD_Plus_USB_Document_Camera)
![]({{site.baseurl}}/https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/assets.ipevo.com/files/product/12-IPEVO_product/IPEVO_Ziggi-HD_Plus_USB_Document_Camera/sildeshow/ipevo_ziggi-hd_plus_slide_05.jpg)
This portable camera provides a great way to share sketches collaboratively with distributed team members. 

####8. [UI Stencils](http://www.uistencils.com)
![]({{site.baseurl}}/https://www.google.com/search?q=ui+stencils&client=safari&rls=en&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAmoVChMI6Jz6tfOayQIVA0cmCh2TMw3j&biw=1179&bih=761#q=ui+stencils&tbm=isch&tbs=isz:l&imgrc=EjM5WEotJfFFtM%3A)
Again, Old Faithful.

####9. [Idea Paint](http://www.ideapaint.com)
![]({{site.baseurl}}/http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51lrC9T5xTL.jpg)
This one is on every UX holiday gift-giving guide you’ll see. It’s a staple and UXers love it!
