BRASH is an indie coffee company with a shop in Chattanooga and one coming soon to Atlanta. They have a passion for finding and sharing the best possible coffee they can. They literally travel the world forging relationships with independant farmers and bringing raw beans back to the US where they roast each batch by hand.

## The Situation
When BRASH approached us they already had a great brand identity but needed help telling their story online and offering their delicious coffee for sale. They had content for the site but needed help implementing it with Squarespace.

## The Solution
We helped create a Squarespace site which captures the essence of the BRASH brand and communicates their message with a clean and simple design. We set up their online store, handling the e-commerce backend and adding all the products on the front end. We chose typography to make the site easy to read and a navigational layout to make it easy to get around.

## The Outcome
BRASH's mission is simply to produce the best coffee they can, and now their website helps the coffee shine and brings it straight to thirsty customers' doors via the online shop. [quote from Chris] We'll definitely be visiting for a cuppa when the shop opens up in Atlanta!
