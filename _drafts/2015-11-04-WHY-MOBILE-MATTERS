!["Say hello to my little friend!" - Scarface, 1983]({{site.baseurl}}/http://media.graytvinc.com/images/smartphone13.jpg)

###I feel naked without my smartphone. 

I’ll admit it: I have what's probably an unhealthy attachment to the palm-sized device that manages my life. This one time, at bandcamp...I mean, this one time, a few months ago, I left my cell phone at home when I headed out for the day. I was halfway to the office when I realized it wasn’t in my car, and immediately I felt like I was missing a limb, or something equally as important. I turned around and drove almost 20 minutes back to the house to grab my phone. I don’t say this with pride, but I do say it honestly. I. Love. My. Smartphone.

I am joined by tens of millions of Americans and other citizens of this spinning celestial ball we call Earth. We are obsessed with, even addicted to, our mobile devices. Our phones and tablets can pay our bills, handle our schedules, make our phone calls, and even entertain us. Now, if only it could do my laundry...

What’s more, research shows that online shoppers are using mobile devices to make purchases at a rapidly accelerating rate.

As a result of this shift, savvy digital designers are realizing that they must consider mobile commerce a hugely critical part of their overall web design process. If a website’s mobile experience isn’t clean, clear, and easy to navigate, chances are good that customers will go elsewhere, resulting in profit loss and lack of brand loyalty.

###SO...HOW CAN DESIGNERS AVOID MOBILE COMMERCE MISTAKES?

#####1. RESPECT THE CLOCK
Did you know that a one-second delay in page response can reduce conversion by 7%? Or that 47% of users expect pages to load in two seconds? 40% say they’ll leave a site if load time exceeds three seconds, and 79% are less likely to use the site again when faced with response delays. These are significant numbers, and it’s apparent that lengthy loading times will affect a company’s bottom line. This won’t fly in today’s uber-competitive marketplace. Life moves fast, and so should your mobile commerce site.

#####2. RESPECT THE FINGER
If your mobile site contains microscopic text and is crammed edge-to-edge with content, links, and pictures, even the world’s tiniest fingers won’t be able to make their selections without error. Frustrated customers will be short-term customers, and in a world where customer loyalty is directly related to profit, this just won’t do. Give your mobile shoppers a clean and uncluttered e-commerce encounter and they’ll thank you for it every time they finger-tap their way into your online shop.

#####3. RESPECT THE CODE
The code used to create websites has come a long way since the early days of the internet. Back in 1996, all we had was a gray background, black text, and blue links. Now we can do really smart things like make the numeric keypad appear instead of the QWERTY alternative when someone is entering a number into a form. Make it your goal to take advantage of the most current coding practices so the e-commerce sites you build are as easy for its visitors to use as possible.

#####4. RESPECT THE SCREEN
Hick’s Law describes the time it takes for a person to make a decision as a result of the possible choices he or she has. The more choices offered, the longer it takes for said person to make a decision. 48% of people say they’ve left a website that had a product they wanted due to an overabundance of options. Don’t overload customers with too many products at once. As a general rule, offering three options at a time is plenty. 

#####5. RESPECT THE PROCESS
There’s no need to reinvent the wheel. Use tried-and-true processes that yield consistent, positive outcomes and growth in sales. When it’s time to explore new digital horizons, forge the mobile e-commerce trail in a way that directly lines up with the needs and desires of the customer, thinking with the mind of your target buyer.

###IN CONCLUSION...

The e-commerce industry would do well to pause for a moment and remember this truth: the future is going to run on mobile devices. iPhones/androids and iPads/other tablets are only going to increase in popularity. Business leaders and designers alike must consider the mobile e-commerce experience to be a priority; if they make online shopping enjoyable and easy for the smartphone or tablet customer, it will impact their bottom lines in a lucrative way.
