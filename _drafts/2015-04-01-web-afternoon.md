Last Friday was another successful Atlanta Web Afternoon. We had a great turnout and tried some new things to foster even more mixing and mingling than in the past.

[Martin Ringlein](https://twitter.com/smarty), CEO of nvite (which we use for Polygon's [Tech Demo Nights](https://nvite.com/AtlTechDemo/c53e)!) kicked things off with a great talk about *launching a startup*. 

> I want to create environments where world-class talent can do world-class work.

Next we heard from [Chidi Afulezi](https://twitter.com/cafulezi), a mobile mogul who took us on a nostalgic trip down *the memory lane of mobile devices* to highlight how far the sector has come. 

**The next part was fun**: we split into *breakout groups* at different restaurants all around Atlantic Station to talk about topics we had selected earlier. We got a chance to snack, drink, and meet people interested in the same things as us.

When we re-grouped, a panel of the discussion leaders recapped. Some highlights:

> A company's culture can be parallel to its brand.  

> Don't treat your golden egg like the red-headed stepchild.  

> The thing I love about the web is that it's always changing and challenging.

And a question for us all to ponder:

## How can I help the web get where we think it ought to go?

[Fabio Carneiro](https://twitter.com/flcarneiro), from Mailchimp, dropped the mic next in schooling us on *email design*. It sounds like email design is tough! It presents a different set of challenges from designing or developing for the web. But he highlighted the active and supportive community that can help anyone get started.

From Anna McDevitt we learned about *working in a niche*. She runs [a marketing agency](https://twitter.com/lab_marketing) that specializes in supporting companies that sell home medical equipment. She reminded us that there are entire populations out there who have no idea what we're talking about when we sling tech phrases around. We should seek out the places that don't have technology in place and help those folks elevate their base level of knowledge by being stewards of best practices on the web. Her main advice? Step outside of your comfort zone and **go for it**.

We closed out the day with some beer from [Greg Hoy](https://twitter.com/hoyboy). It was a requirement for his talk: *how to collaborate like a craft brewer*. It involves working together, embracing industry peers as team members, and sharing ideas.

## People want to see Batman and Superman team up.

By cultivating a circle of influence where we share experiences and strategies and are brutally honest with each other, we can all be inspired. And making better, more inspired craftspeople makes the entire industry better.

That's something all of us webbies can drink to, and we got to, at the after party!

Web Afternoon was a great opportunity to see some familiar faces and meet people who will now be familiar faces at the next event. This one encompassed a wide swatch of *the web*, but the [next event](http://webafternoon.com/) on August 28 will narrow the focus in on User Experience Design. We already can't wait.
