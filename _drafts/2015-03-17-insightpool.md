Insightpool is a social relationship intelligence platform whose algorithms help customers connect with influencers and prospects on social media. Customers can then create personalized interactions with those users to enhance their experience with the brand. It integrates with the sales and marketing tools companies are already using, and numerous customers like IHG, UPS, and the Atlanta Hawks have all seen a huge boost in sales and engagement from using Insightpool.

## The Situation
Insightpool counts on the concept of "social currency" to foster online relationships between brands and their users. Say a global beverage company is using Insightpool, and they get word of a tweet that someone has enjoyed their product. They can respond to that person saying they're glad they enjoyed it and offering them a coupon for a dollar off their next purchase. Though it doesn't have to be monetary, social currency is about rewarding people for posting positive sentiments about your brand or product. It's tying a specific action on the part of the brand to positive comments from consumers--a sort of goodwill feedback loop turning conversations into results.

Insightpool brought us on to build a landing page to communicate the concept of social currency and demonstrate its value to their prospects and customers. 

## The Solution
We helped Insightpool define the story that they wanted to tell about social currency and list out the talking points for their microsite. Then, we designed and built the site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

The landing page was to be a collection point for leads that the company could then market their services to, so we tied it into Pardot, a marketing automation service that Insightpool was already using. 

Finally, we integrated the page with Twitter, allowing visitors to tweet about social currency directly from the site. Tweets are automatically tagged with the hashtag "#socialcurrency."

## The Outcome
Insightpool received funding that required they focus their attention elsewhere for the time being, so the social currency site has yet to launch.
