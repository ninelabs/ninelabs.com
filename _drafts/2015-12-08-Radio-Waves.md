It’s always a treat when one of our own graces the radio waves! This week, Nine Labs founder and president, J Cornelius, had the pleasure of sitting down with Eric Holtzclaw of [the Eric Holtzclaw Show](http://ericholtzclaw.com) (1190am in Atlanta from 11a-12p, weekdays). Eric is a “serial entrepreneur” with 20+ years experience, and he’s passionate about helping other self-starters along their journeys. 

Eric and J talked user-friendly websites and mobile sites for business, and also touched on Samsung’s new “consumer friendly” [VR headset](http://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/wearables/gear-vr/).

I could tell you more, but I think you’d rather hear the words from the horses’ mouths. Take a few minutes and listen to J and Eric’s exchange here:
