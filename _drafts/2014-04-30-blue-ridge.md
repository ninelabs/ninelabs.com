BlueRidge was built to scratch an itch we had within our own workflow. It's an app that connects to your Basecamp account and allows you to see all of the to-dos across projects and filter them by date or however else you'd like. It's not a to-do app or a replacement for Basecamp, but it *does* make using Basecamp easier.

## The Situation
We were tired of losing time sifting through our to-dos on Basecamp. The "Me" view was okay, but even there, the projects are sorted alphabetically, not by priority or due date. And, for project managers, it was a nightmare having to sift through every project to keep up with their team's tasks.

## The Solution
We wanted BlueRidge to look and feel like Basecamp to give users a visual reminder that they were working with Basecamp to-dos, so we mimiced the existing UI and mocked up what the views should look like. [Moses](https://ninelabs.com/experience/moses-ngone.html) dug into the Basecamp API and wrote PHP and JavaScript code that would grab all of the to-do's from it. Then, he made sure that the big list created in BlueRidge could be filtered on a number of different criteria.

At first we worked on this in the margins, just a few hours each week. But a few people who saw it said it was something they would definitely use, so we launched it into a full-blown product.

## The Outcome
BlueRidge is currently for sale online and has a number of users already signed up. You can access up to three Basecamp projects for free, with tiered pricing up to $19.95 a month giving you access to many more.

We've moved the app over to [Aseembly](https://assembly.com/), a collaborative product development platform, because it's turned into a bigger product than we have the time to dedicate to. We'll talk more about how that transition went in a later post. But, the hope is that by opening it up to a collective of developers, designers, and marketers who will share in the profits, the app will grow beyond what we could have supported. Because we think it's a kick-ass idea that solves a problem plenty of people have.
