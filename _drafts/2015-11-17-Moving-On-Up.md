Over the past few days we’ve been discussing how thrilled we are about the growth of the creative industry in the Atlanta area, as well as what an incredible sense of community we now experience on a regular basis with fellow designers. We’ve always been about expanding, unifying, and supporting the Atlanta tech collective, and we are greatly encouraged to see this happening all over our city.

As you probably know, Nine Labs has managed an event facility for the last year at Atlantic Station called Polygon. We opened Polygon with the goal of making centrally-located tech gatherings possible for any and all who were interested in coming together to make creative ideas come to life. This has most definitely been accomplished, and then some, as other spaces for large-group gatherings have trickled onto the scene. Polygon has been so successful, in fact, that we’re running out of space for many of our gatherings. This is a problem, yes, but what a great problem to have!

Realizing our increasing limitations, we began exploring other options for a community event space, and to our delight we discovered Scott Henderson’s latest venture, The Garage, located in the SQ5 tower in Tech Square.

Not only is the space three times larger than Polygon (8000 square feet), its setup is also designed to comfortably handle the many needs of large groups. The space features balcony seating, soft lounge areas, high-top collaboration tables, and a fully-equipped stage. Best of all, by relocating our event lineup to The Garage, our team will no longer have to manage an event space, giving us the freedom to focus more on our clients and better serve their needs.

Yes, this means that Polygon will be closing its doors (effective Dec. 27), but we’re anxiously awaiting the opening of The Garage at Tech Square in January 2016 because we know that the move will enable us to continue encouraging growth and unity within the Atlanta tech community. We’re excited about the future, not only for Nine Labs, but for Atlanta’s creative establishment as a whole, and we are thankful to play a small role in its success.
