Welcome to the 21st century, an era when keeping up with the Joneses is a full-time job. Where are you living? Who are you wearing? What are you driving? In this day and age, cutting-edge fashion and designer duds dominate, and no one wants to be left with their knock-off True Religion jeans down around their ankles while the competition strolls on past in Adriano Goldschmied.

Much in the same way, it’s easy to feel insecure about your company’s online presence in the current digital age. Businesses have higher standards than ever when it comes to web design, and no one wants their company represented by a less-than-stellar site. From small startups to Fortune 500 companies, the pressure is actually quite similar: deliver a top-of-the-line, engaging web experience, or risk losing customer loyalty and revenue.

###The only difference between startups and Fortune 500 companies? Just a few billion dollars.

If you represent a small business, or a startup that’s just getting off the ground, take a moment to pause. Breathe slowly. Back away from the ledge.

Yes, it would be easy to get swept away in the mega-corp tidal wave of dollars and cents, to push yourself to keep up with the Amazons and Googles of the world. It would be easy to spend money you don’t have to create a website infrastructure that dazzles the world.

###But.

Maybe it’s time small businesses take a different approach. Instead of keeping up with the Joneses at the expense of your bottom line and ultimately your business, maybe you do the very best you can with the resources you currently have. Maybe you take the old-fashioned approach of building your business one pixelated brick at a time, realizing that no company starts out at the top, but that instead a smart organization slowly works its way there over time through hard work and and measured strategies.

Rest assured, Fortune 500 companies didn’t start out with the websites you see online today. On the contrary, if you research your favorite brands and their original web pages, you’ll see a drastic difference between what was available 20 years ago and what they present now. Some of this is attributed to constantly-improving technology, to be sure, but it is also directly tied to company growth and revenue.

###Change takes time, obviously!

Great web designers are aware of this, and they push their clients toward online greatness while at the same time respecting a company’s current position in the marketplace. They understand that there’s value in investing in good design, even if it’s a small investment for a small startup, because small investments often lead to big returns. Trusted designers honor their clients’ budgets and the hard work it takes for startups to establish even a meager revenue stream. He or she will work to help you create a website that looks good, functions wells, and represents your company honestly;  AND help you to continue to refine and grow your website as your business grows.

In short, don’t jump into the digital rat race if you’re not ready. Don’t try to keep up with the bigwigs for the sake of status. Be you and do a good job being you and your business (and its online pursuits) will grow like a small business should - slowly, steadily, and smart.
