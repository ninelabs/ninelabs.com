There&rsquo;s a reason we don&rsquo;t have perpetual motion: **friction**.

> **fric·tion** /ˈfrikSH(ə)n/ noun &mdash; the resistance that one surface or object encounters when moving over another

It exists at every level of our physical world. That&rsquo;s cool, you might be thinking, but I didn&rsquo;t realize this was a science blog. It&rsquo;s not! The same concept of friction can actually be applied to user experience design.

Friction, in that sense, is **anything that gets in the way of a user achieiving a desired outcome**. You&rsquo;ve felt it--you&rsquo;re online trying to decide where to eat dinner, and you find what looks like the perfect spot. You click over to their website and...WHAM! You can&rsquo;t figure out where to look for their address. It&rsquo;s not in any of the usual spots on the page. No phone number either. The likelihood of you actually going there to eat becomes slim to none. Friction is a bummer.

If you&rsquo;re that restaurant, you want to reduce friction on your website as much as possible. You want to make it clear where you&rsquo;re located and that you take reservations. Maybe you even let visitors make that reservation through an embedded portal on your site. It&rsquo;s like greasing a wheel. The gear turns more smoothly, and you&rsquo;ve got a paying customer at a table.

### Three things that can cause friction:

#### Too Much Effort Needed to Complete a Task
This isn&rsquo;t about laziness. This is about eliminating steps that could be avoided. That&rsquo;s why a lot of us like keyboard shortcuts. When we&rsquo;re typing, our fingers are already on the keys, so it&rsquo;s much easier to click ⌘ + c than to move away to the trackpad. Think about how you can provide the information your customers need in the least number of steps possible.

#### Too Much Context Switching
Study after study has shown that multitasking is actually a lie. You&rsquo;re not really working on two tasks at once--you&rsquo;re mentally switching between the two, albeit rapidly, and therefore being less effective at them both. It was a revelation when the Kindle introduced an included dictionary, so when you&rsquo;re reading and stumble over a word, you can immediately highlight and look it up. No need to get up, hunt down the ole Webster&rsquo;s, remember the alphabet...nope, I got my answer right from my comfy chair and can get back to the plot at hand. What&rsquo;s your equivalent to the Kindle&rsquo;s dictionary?

#### Too Many Decisions
[Decision fatigue is real](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue). Having more choices isn&rsquo;t always better. I&rsquo;ve noticed this trend on restaurant menus. They tend to specialize more, offering just a few rotating, seasonal choices rather than the Cheescake Factory approach of making a little bit of everything.

The menu is a one-pager rather than a book. If you don&rsquo;t like anything on it, then that&rsquo;s tough. But as long as you do, it&rsquo;s less exhausting trying to order and you can get to fun part of eating more quickly. Extensive drop down navigation options are the Cheesecake Factory behemoth menu of the web. You don&rsquo;t need them.

### Ways To Reduce Friction
You don&rsquo;t need to care about the friction that keeps scientists from building a perpetual motion machine, but you *do* need to care about the friction that keeps your customers from closing the deal. Luckily, that&rsquo;s an easier hill to climb.
