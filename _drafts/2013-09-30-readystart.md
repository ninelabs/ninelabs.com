Sentara Capital is a boutique registered investment advisory based in Marietta, Georgia that offers services in several states across the Southeast. Through ReadyStart, they focus specifically on retirement and help new and intermediate investors take control of their options. The tool offers adice, progress-tracking,, financial forecasting, and personalized planning.

## The Situation
Sentara wanted a landing page for ReadyStart that would present it as an offering in its own right, separate from the site detailing the firm's entire suite of services. The page needed to outline major details and provide a way for people who were interested to get in touch with the team and request more information.

## The Solution
We created an attractive single-page website which explains the service and its benefits. To empower the team at Sentara, we built the informational form in a way that allow them to make changes easily should their needs change down the road.

## The Outcome
The ReadyStart landing page drives x traffic to Sentara's site and has generated y sign-ups for 401k advice packages. It is clean and straightforward.
