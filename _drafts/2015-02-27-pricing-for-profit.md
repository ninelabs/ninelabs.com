Join us on March 20th at Polygon for our first in a series of workshops on running a shop.

## Do you feel like you’re never paid enough for your work? 
Are you losing money on most of your projects? Are your client revisions out of control? Does your profit seem to melt away as each project goes along? Are you spending most of your time writing proposals only to lose the work?

## Correctly pricing your client work for profit isn’t a guessing game. 
You can get control. This is a hands-on workshop made specifically for creative business owners. Together, we will look at specific ways to tackle pricing and profit in your business. We'll have open discussions about rates, prices, and profit using actual projects. You’ll walk away with real numbers and tools to use in your business to get control of your pricing strategy the very same day.

Brad’s got an eye for design. A User Experience generalist, his background includes product development, interactive, branding, and market segmentation. He can design your graphics, optimize for user experience, code the front-end of your website, or lay out your iOS application. He’s worked with big name clients like MTV, AT&T, ESPN, Disney, Columbia Records, NATO, The PGA, Coca-Cola, UnitedHealth Group, Macy’s, and Hard Rock Café, but he’s also folded clothes, pumped gas, bagged groceries, and sold cell phones.

As the CEO and Creative Director of Suckerpunch Studios, which he founded, Brad worked collaboratively with clients to solve business marketing challenges. Previously, he served as the Online Media Manager and Product Branding specialist for Verizon Wireless and did Visual Merchandising for American Eagle. His book, Creative Truth, releases fall 2015 from Focal Press. 

He’s a big fan of minimal design, Scotch, and Oxford commas. He’s known for his loquaciousness and his barbeque sauce. When he’s not in front of a whiteboard, sketch pad, or monitor, you might stumble across Brad in the middle of the movie you’re watching. His superpower, naturally, would be mind-reading.
