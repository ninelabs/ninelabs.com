    <p class="lead">Anyone can take on a project. It’s how you get them done that matters.</p>
    <p>From creating a brand for a new company to a complete overhaul of an existing e-commerce website, we’ve got you covered. There’s a good chance we’ve tackled <a href="/about/reputation.html">a similar project</a> in the past and know just how to get yours done.</p>

    <h3>We&rsquo;re on your side.</h3>
    <p>We <a href="/notes/better-together.html">work with your team</a> through active collaboration and rapid iteration. Our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_management">Agile process</a> ensures steady progress towards your goals and full transparency along the way.</p>

    <h3>Project Phases</h3>
    <ol class="padded">
      <li><strong>Research:</strong> It’s important that we gain understanding of the current situation, as well as what needs to happen moving forward, before we begin work. In this phase, we wrap our heads around the project and create the roadmap to get it done (our <a href="/approach/short-term.html">short-term sessions</a> are great for this phase).</li>
      <li><strong>Advise:</strong> All the knowledge and insight we gathered in the Research Phase gets compiled into a report. We sit down with your team to go over the plan, mapping out what happens next.</li>
      <li><strong>Act:</strong> This is where the rubber meets the road. The project starts to take shape and the the plan comes together (we love it when that happens). We work alongside your team, leading the process and ensuring everyone knows what’s happening.</li>
      <li><strong>Measure:</strong> If we don’t examine the results, there's no way to know if the project accomplished its goals. We schedule regular check-ins to look at data and make sure our efforts paid off.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Let&rsquo;s Chat About Your Project</h3>
    <p>Project timelines typically range from three weeks to six months, with budgets from $20,000 to $500,000. If your project falls within these ranges, let’s talk.</p>

        <p>Working with Nine Labs was wonderful. I was able to bring a jumble of ideas and content to the table and they were able to organize and craft it into exactly what I needed. The team is not only talented, but also extremely communicative and responsive.</p>

        <p>They have a wonderful talent for really hearing what's being asked to create, and an extraordinary ability to pull it all together, sort out the chaos, and fill in the details. Results are always top quality. I very highly recommend this talented team.</p>
