    <p>When buying a house you have to consider what your needs are. Do you need a seven-bedroom chateau, or a two-bedroom starter home? Maybe an apartment will do for now, or maybe you want to build something completely custom.</p>

    <h3>The Initial Needs Assessment</h3>
    <p>Before our team does anything, we need to learn about your needs and goals. A 20-minute phone call generally gives us a high-level view of what you need and how to best proceed.</p>
    <p>After the call, we prepare and propose the steps that should be taken next. Our proposals generally contain three options for how to pursue the project, and we'll discuss those option with you to find the one that best suits your needs.</p>
    <p>Here's what happens next if you choose to proceed&hellip;</li>

    <h3>Discovery</h3>
    <p>A half-day to two-day session, offering the opportunity for questions to be asked, project goals to be defined and documented, and a chance to “test drive” our working relationship to make sure we’re a good fit before embarking on the bigger project. Cost of the Discovery is based on our <a href="/approach/short-term.html">short-term consulting</a> rates.</p>
    <p><strong>Results:</strong> You can expect to get a situation appraisal, high-level project roadmap, and a budget and timeline estimate. The more discovery we do, the more accurate the estimate will be.</p>

    <h2>The Project</h2>
    <p>The real fun begins once discovery is complete. Once you approve the project budget and timeline, we’ll get it on the books and begin work.</p>

    <h4>Activities</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Two-week cycles of work based on the project plan defined in Discovery.</li>
    <li>Status report every-other Wednesday showing:</li>
    <li>Status of project budget and timeline</li>
    <li>Last cycle’s accomplishments</li>
    <li>Plans for the next cycle</li>
    <li>What we need from you (if anything)</li>
    <li>Any project concerns</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Depending on the scope of the project, we will schedule occasional in-person meetings to make sure all your questions are answered and everything remains on track.</p>
