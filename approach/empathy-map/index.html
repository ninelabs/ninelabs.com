  <p>Empathy maps are a simple, yet powerful tool to help us understand and empathize with our users and customers. They were developed by XPLANE as a method for understanding audiences, including users, customers, and other players in any business ecosystem (<a href="http://gamestorming.com/core-games/empathy-mapping/">read more</a>).</p>

  <p>All Empathy Maps have four quadrants: &ldquo;Thinking,&rdquo; &ldquo;Seeing,&rdquo; &ldquo;Doing,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Feeling&rdquo;. Many versions (including ours) have two additional boxes at the bottom of the quadrants: &ldquo;Pains&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gains.&rdquo; Usually, a drawing of a human head at the center of the empathy map reminds us we are talking about a real, live person.</p>
  <h3>Using the Map</h3>
  <p>It&rsquo;s best to draw your own on a whiteboard and use sticky notes, but you can also download and use our template:</p>

  </p>
  <p>Now it’s time to practice the &ldquo;empathy&rdquo; portion of the exercise. As best you can, try to project yourself into that person&rsquo;s experience and understand the context you want to explore. Then start to fill in the diagram with real, tangible, sensory experiences. Ask questions like:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>How do they think about their fears and hopes?</li>
    <li>What do they hear when other people use your product?</li>
    <li>What do they see when they use your product? What is the environment?</li>
    <li>What do they say or feel when using your product, whether in private or public?</li>
    <li>What are their pain points when using your product?</li>
    <li>Is this a positive or a painful experience for them?</li>
    <li>What does a typical day look like in their world?</li>
    <li>Do they hear positive feedback about your company from external sources?</li>
    <li>What do they hope to gain from using your product?</li>
    <li>Has your customer repeated quotes or defining words?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Fill in the answers as you have them, don&rsquo;t worry about being neat and tidy. If you are filling in the &ldquo;hearing&rdquo; section, for example, try to think of what the person might hear, and how they would hear it. In the &ldquo;saying&rdquo; section, try to write their thoughts as they would express them. Don’t put your words into their mouth &mdash; the point is to truly understand and empathize with their situation so you can design a better product, service or whatever.</p>

  <h4>Check Your Work</h4>
  <p>Ask others to review your map, make suggestions, and add details or context. The more the person can identify with the actual stakeholder the better. Over time you will hone your ability to understand and empathize with others in your business ecosystem, which will help you improve your relationships and your results.</p>
