    <p class="lead">If you’re at all involved in the process of web design, you’ve probably heard the terms “wireframe,” “mockup,” and “prototype” thrown around a good bit, and often interchangeably.</p>
    <p class="lead">The definitions of these three phases of design have become somewhat muddled, and even designers can understand them differently. We’d like to take a moment to break down the three phases of design and to clearly define their purposes.</p>

        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <h5>Level of detail: Low // Cost: $</h5>

      <div class="description">
        <p class="lead">A wireframe represents the structure of a design. Think of it as the frame, or body, of a car.</p>
        <h4>How does it work?</h4>
        <p>A wireframe is not sleek or colorful (that comes in later phases). It’s very basic, and its focus is on structure and the arrangement of elements on the page. It’s a tool used to help people imagine what a page will look like without actually having to see it 100% complete on a screen. Wireframes are essential for defining a project’s scope, and they help determine content needs. Most importantly, wires help facilitate discussion of design and functional features.</p>
        <h4>What can it do for me?</h4>
        <p>A wireframe helps to reveal design pitfalls that are hard to imagine without the help of a visual. Because it’s sketched out and unfinished, clients have an easy time visualizing changes, adjustments, and improvements without being worried about drawing on top of a beautiful web design or throwing away a ton of money redeveloping something that’s already been completed.</p>

        <h2>Mockups <small>(a.k.a. Comps)</small></h2>
        <h5>Level of detail: Medium // Cost: $$</h5>
      </hgroup>

      <div class="description">
        <p class="lead">A mockup is a high-fidelity flat file that shows what the product/user interface will look like. Continuing with the car analogy, a mockup would be the paint and interior.</p>
        <h4>How does it work?</h4>
        <p>A mockup brings a wireframe to life by showcasing all aspects of design (color, typography, hierarchy, and some functionality) in a static form. It shows the structure and hierarchy of content, and encourages people to review and hone the visual side of the project.</p>
        <h4>What can it do for me?</h4>
        <p>It allows you to get content in front of other people, which is especially useful when you want to get early buy-in from a stakeholder. It elicits more in-depth feedback than the basic wireframe, and allows for more detailed troubleshooting.</p>

        <h2>Prototypes</h2>
        <h5>Level of detail: High // Cost: $$$</h5>

      <div class="description">
        <p class="lead">A prototype is a high-fidelity version of the final product. It might not look exactly as it will once completed, but it should be close.</p>
        <h4>How does it work?</h4>
        <p>It allows users to experience and interact with the interface, and to run necessary functionality tests. Think of it as the first car an automobile manufacturer builds, fills with crash-test dummies, and sends to the quality assurance team for testing. When used properly, a prototype tests user experience and functionality to check for problems before final development begins.</p>
        <h4>What can it do for me?</h4>
        <p>It allows you to run tests and check for potential problems as though you were doing so using the final product. It sheds light on design flaws and makes obvious what needs to be changed before production.</p>

    <p class="lead">Many times you can learn a lot about what you want to build by making a wireframe. Sometimes a Mockup is more appropriate. Sometimes the best way to communicate your idea is with a Prototype.</p>
    <p class="lead">Don't let the differences confuse you or stop you from making progress. We can help you understand what's best for your project in a single day.</p>
