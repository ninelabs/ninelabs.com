# Working With Us
----

When you want to buy a house you have to decide what your needs are. Do you need a 7 bedroom chateau, or a 2 bedroom starter home? Maybe an apartment will do for now, or maybe you want to build something completely custom.

----
## The Initial Needs Assessment
----

Before we do anything we need to learn about your needs and goals. A 20 minute call is generally enough to get a high level view of what you need and how best to proceed.

After the call we will prepare a propsal for next steps.

- **Discovery:** Three [Discovery](#discovery) options with increasing levels of accuracy
- **Hybrid:** Two [Discovery](#discovery) options and one "Gung-ho" price to just get started.
- **Project:** Three options for how to pursue the project. Small, Medium, Large

We'll have a follow-up call to discuss the proposal and answer any questions.

Here's what happens next if you choose to proceed&hellip;

----
## Discovery
----
1/2-day to 2-day session to ask questions, define and document project goals, and test drive each other to make sure there's a good fit before embarking on the bigger project.Cost is based on our [short-term](/short-term/) pricing.

### Results
You can expect to get a [situation appraisal](/situation-appraisal/), [high-level project roadmap](/project-roadmap/), and a budget and timeline estimate. The more discovery we do, the more accurate the estimate.

----
## The Project
----

The fun begins once discovery is complete. Once you approve of the project budget and timeline we will schedule the project and begin work.

### Activities
- Two-week cycles of work based on the project plan defined in Discovery.
- We provide a status report every other Wednesday showing:
  - Status of project budget and timeline
  - What has been accomplished in the last cycle
  - What is planned for the next cycle
  - What we need from you (if anything)
  - Any concerns we have about the project

Depending on the scope of the project we will schedule occasional in person meetings to make sure all your questions are answered and everything is on track.

### Financials
- Deposit to be paid up front before work begins. Deposit about based on total project budget:
  - Under 25k: 50%
  - 25k to 50k: 35%
  - 50k to 100k: 25%
  - 100k to 500k: 20%
  - 500k and up: 10%
- Balance to be paid bi-weekly over the remainder of the project timeline, invoiced due upon receipt
