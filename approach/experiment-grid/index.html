  <p>Originally created by <a href="http://www.alissabriggs.com/experiment-grid/">Alissa Briggs</a>, the Experiment Grid is a great tool to help groups or teams discuss what they want to try and document the results. We've found it to be a helpful tool when disucssing ideas and how to act on them.</p>

  <h3>Using the Grid</h3>
  <p>It&rsquo;s best to draw your own on a whiteboard and use sticky notes, but you can also download and use our PDF template:</p>
  <p style="margin-left:2em">
    <a href="//s3.amazonaws.com/ninelabs.com/ExperimentGrid.pdf" class="btn"><i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o"></i> Download the PDF</a>
  </p>
  <p>Fill in the answers as you have them, don&rsquo;t worry about being neat and tidy..</p>

  <h4>Check Your Work</h4>
  <p>Ask others to review your grid, make suggestions, and add details or context.</p>
